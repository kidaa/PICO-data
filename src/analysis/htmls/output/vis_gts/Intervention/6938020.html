EORTC protocols in prostatic cancer . An interim report . 
<br>
<br> Two parallel prospective randomized studies have been undertaken by the EORTC Urological Group in previously untreated patients with prostatic cancer in order to compare <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">Stilboestrol_4</font> <font color="red">versus_2</font> <font color="red">Cyproterone_4</font> <font color="red">acetate_3</font> <font color="red">versus_2</font> <font color="red">Medroxyprogesterone_4</font> <font color="red">acetate_4</font> in the first trial , and <font color="red">Stilboestrol_1</font> versus <font color="red">Estracyt_1</font> in the second trial . Although the follow up is still short , no superiority of the other drugs over <font color="red">Stilboestrol_2</font> had appeared so far with regard to either objective response or significant side effects apart from gynaecomastia . In the third trial , patients with advanced disease no longer responsive to hormonal treatment were randomized to either <font color="red">Adriamycin_2</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">Procarbazine_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Toxicity and early death were particularly frequent in <font color="red">Procarbazine_2</font> treated patients , whereas most patients progressed in both treatment groups .
