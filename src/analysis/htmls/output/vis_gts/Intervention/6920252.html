Experimental hyaline membrane disease in the premature monkey : effects of <font color="red">antenatal_2</font> <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> A blind , randomized trial of <font color="red">antenatal_2</font> <font color="red">glucocorticoid_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_2</font> was conducted using the premature monkey ( Macaca nemestrina ) model of hyaline membrane disease ( HMD ) . Twelve dams received <font color="red">dexamethasone_4</font> ( 2 mg / dose ) 72 , 48 , and 24 h before abdominal delivery at 135 + /- 1 days of gestation . Twelve control animals received <font color="red">saline_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Infants of <font color="red">dexamethasone_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> treated dams had significantly lower incidence and severity of HMD than did infants of control animals ( 50 versus 92% , p less than 0.05 ) . Improvement with treatment was markedly greater for males than for females . Differences in volume - pressure behavior of the excised lungs included greater distensibility in the infants from <font color="red">dexamethasone_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> treated dams ( 20.6 + /- 7.1 ml / g dry lung versus 14.7 + /- 6.1 , p less than 0.05 ) and enhanced deflation stability with treatment . Accelerated production of surface active material ( SAM ) phospholipids in infants from <font color="red">dexamethasone_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> treated dams was indicated by increases in total lung phospholipid ( 84.5 + /- 8.1 mg / g dry lung versus 75.1 + /- 9.9 , p less than 0.025 ) , alveolar lavage fluid phospholipid ( 5.65 + /- 3.33 mg / g dry lung versus 3.01 + /- 1.84 , p less than 0.05 ) , and alveolar lavage fluid disaturated phosphatidylcholine ( DPC ) ( 2.47 + /- 1.84 mg / g dry lung versus 1.06 + /- 1.05 , p less than 0.05 ) . Incorporation of 14C - palmitate into lung lipid was not influenced by dexamethasone , but a significantly greater portion of the label appeared in the DPC fraction with treatment . <font color="red">Antenatal_2</font> <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_2</font> was successful in reducing the incidence and severity of experimental HMD in this animal model ; the beneficial effects of treatment were associated with accelerated maturation of fetal pulmonary functions , including , but not limited to , synthetic metabolism of SAM phospholipid .
