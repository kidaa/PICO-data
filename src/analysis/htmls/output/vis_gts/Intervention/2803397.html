[ The sympatho - adrenergic stress reaction in ear surgery using various anesthesia technics ] . 
<br>
<br> The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various anaesthetic procedures on the endocrine stress responses during ear microsurgical operations . Simple mastoidectomies , radical mastoidectomies and tympano plastics were carried out in 49 patients under the following randomised anaesthetic procedures : Group 1 <font color="red">halothane_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">retroauricular_2</font> <font color="red">infiltration_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">lidocaine_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">ornipressin_2</font> ( n = 14 ) , Group 2 <font color="red">fentanyl_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">retroauricular_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">lidocaine_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">ornipressin_2</font> ( n = 10 ) , Group 3 <font color="red">fentanyl_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">retroauricular_2</font> <font color="red">infiltration_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">lidocaine_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">epinephrine_2</font> ( n = 14 ) , and Group 4 <font color="red">retroauricular_2</font> <font color="red">infiltration_2</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">prilocaine_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">epinephrine_2</font> ( n = 14 ) . The plasma levels of epinephrine , norepinephrine , glucose , lactate and free glycerol were measured in addition to mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ) immediately before anaesthesia , 10 minutes after skin incision , 10 minutes after having started bone drilling , at the end of the operation and 3 hours after operation . All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor . Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia ( Groups 1 - 3 ) . Plasma catecholamines ( epinephrine and norepinephrine ) increased significantly in Group 4 ( retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia ) . There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR . The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose , lactate and free glycerol . The beneficial effect of general anaesthesia is documented by normal plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
