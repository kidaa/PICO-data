Comparison of <font color="red">budesonide_2</font> <font color="red">Turbuhaler_1</font> with <font color="red">budesonide_1</font> <font color="red">aqua_1</font> in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis . Rhinocort Study Group . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of <font color="red">budesonide_2</font> <font color="red">Turbuhaler_1</font> 400 microg / day with <font color="red">budesonide_1</font> <font color="red">aqua_1</font> 256 microg / day in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) . Secondarily to ascertain patients ' preferences for the two nasal devices and to assess quality of life . 
<br> DESIGN Randomized , multicentre , double - blind , double- dummy , parallel groups study . 
<br> SETTING Private practices and hospital clinics in Ontario , Quebec and Manitoba . 
<br> POPULATION Two hundred and eighty - four out - patients with SAR , who were symptomatic during the ragweed season , volunteered for enrolment ( 243 randomized ) . 
<br> RESULTS Mean daily nasal symptom scores were significantly reduced with treatment . There were no statistically significant changes from baseline for eye symptoms . Most patients ( more than 80% ) achieved substantial control of their symptoms with <font color="red">budesonide_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The most common nasal and non - nasal adverse events for both groups were epistaxis and headache . <font color="red">Turbuhaler_1</font> was easier to use and more convenient to carry , had less of an unpleasant taste , and caused less nasal irritation than the <font color="red">aqua_1</font> <font color="red">spray_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> More than twice as many patients preferred <font color="red">Turbuhaler_1</font> to the <font color="red">aqua_1</font> <font color="red">spray_1</font> ( 69% versus 31% ) . Improvement in quality of life from baseline to clinic visits was statistically significant in both groups . 
<br> CONCLUSION Once daily use of 256 mg of <font color="red">budesonide_2</font> <font color="red">aqua_1</font> and 400 mg of <font color="red">budesonide_1</font> <font color="red">Turbuhaler_1</font> are equally safe and efficacious in the treatment of SAR . Patients preferred the <font color="red">budesonide_2</font> <font color="red">powder_1</font> <font color="red">formulation_1</font> <font color="red">delivered_1</font> <font color="red">via_1</font> <font color="red">Turbuhaler_1</font> two to one over the <font color="red">aqua_1</font> <font color="red">formulation_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
