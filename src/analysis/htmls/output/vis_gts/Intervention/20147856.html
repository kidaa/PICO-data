Randomized phase II study of two different schedules of <font color="red">gemcitabine_2</font> and oral <font color="red">S-1_1</font> in chemo - naïve patients with advanced non - small cell lung cancer . 
<br>
<br> INTRODUCTION This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety and to compare dosing schedules of <font color="red">gemcitabine_2</font> <font color="red">combined_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">S-1_1</font> in chemo - naïve non - small cell lung cancer patients . 
<br> METHODS Patients with chemo - naïve stage IIIB / IV non - small cell lung cancer were randomized into two treatment arms . Patients were given oral <font color="red">S-1_1</font> ( 60 mg / m / d , twice a day ) from days 1 to 14 with <font color="red">gemcitabine_2</font> ( 1000 mg / m / d ) on days 1 and 8 ( arm A ) or on days 8 and 15 ( arm B ) . This cycle was repeated every 21 days . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 80 patients were entered in this trial . The primary end point of this study was response rate . The response rates of arm A and arm B were 22.0 and 28.9% , respectively ( p = 0.606 ) . Median time to treatment failure in arm A was 3.6 months and 4.8 months in arm B. Median time to progression in arm A was 4.1 months and 5.5 months in arm B. Median survival time in arm A and arm B was 15.5 months and 18.8 months , respectively . The toxicity profile was relatively mild and did not differ very much between two arms . 
<br> CONCLUSION The <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">gemcitabine_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">S-1_1</font> was determined to be feasible and effective for advanced non - small cell lung cancer . We selected arm B for further studies because of its higher response rate and survival data .
