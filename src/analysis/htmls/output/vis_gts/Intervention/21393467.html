<font color="red">Distinct_1</font> <font color="red">fast_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">slow_1</font> <font color="red">processes_1</font> contribute to the selection of preferred <font color="red">step_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> <font color="red">during_1</font> <font color="red">human_1</font> <font color="red">walking_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>

<br> Humans spontaneously select a <font color="red">step_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> that minimizes the energy expenditure of <font color="red">walking_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> This selection might be embedded within the neural circuits that generate gait so that the optimum is pre - programmed for a given walking speed . Or perhaps <font color="red">step_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> is directly optimized , based on sensed feedback of energy expenditure . Direct optimization is expected to be slow due to the compounded effect of delays and iteration , whereas a pre - programmed mechanism presumably allows for faster step frequency selection , albeit dependent on prior experience . To test for both pre - programmed selection and direct optimization , we applied <font color="red">perturbations_4</font> <font color="red">to_4</font> <font color="red">treadmill_4</font> <font color="red">walking_4</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">elicit_1</font> <font color="red">transient_1</font> <font color="red">changes_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">step_2</font> <font color="red">frequency_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> We found that <font color="red">human_1</font> <font color="red">step_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> adjustments ( n = 7 ) occurred with two components , the first dominating the response ( 66 ± 10% of total amplitude change ; mean ± SD ) and occurring quite quickly ( 1.44 ± 1.14 s to complete 95% of total change ) . The other component was of smaller amplitude ( 35 ± 10% of total change ) and took tens of seconds ( 27.56 ± 16.18 s for 95% completion ) . The <font color="red">fast_1</font> <font color="red">process_1</font> appeared to be too fast for direct optimization and more indicative of a pre - programmed response . It also persisted even with unusual <font color="red">closed_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">loop_1</font> <font color="red">perturbations_1</font> that conflicted with prior experience and rendered the response energetically suboptimal . The <font color="red">slow_1</font> <font color="red">process_1</font> was more consistent with the timing expected for direct optimization . Our interpretation of these results is that humans may rely heavily on pre - programmed gaits to rapidly select their preferred <font color="red">step_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> and then gradually fine - tune that selection with direct optimization .
