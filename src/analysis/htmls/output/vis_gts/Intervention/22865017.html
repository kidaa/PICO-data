RESPECT - PTSD : re - engineering systems for the primary care treatment of PTSD , a randomized controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Although <font color="red">collaborative_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> is effective for treating depression and other mental disorders in primary care , there have been no randomized trials of <font color="red">collaborative_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> specifically for patients with Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare a collaborative approach , the <font color="red">Three_2</font> <font color="red">Component_2</font> <font color="red">Model_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">3CM_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> with <font color="red">usual_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> for treating PTSD in primary care . 
<br> DESIGN The study was a two - arm , parallel randomized clinical trial . PTSD patients were recruited from five primary care clinics at four Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities and randomized to receive <font color="red">usual_2</font> <font color="red">care_2</font> or <font color="red">usual_2</font> <font color="red">care_2</font> <font color="red">plus_2</font> <font color="red">3CM_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Blinded assessors collected data at baseline and 3-month and 6-month follow - up . 
<br> PARTICIPANTS Participants were 195 Veterans . Their average age was 45 years , 91% were male , 58% were white , 40% served in Iraq or Afghanistan , and 42% served in Vietnam . 
<br> INTERVENTION All participants received <font color="red">usual_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Participants assigned to <font color="red">3CM_2</font> also received <font color="red">telephone_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">management_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Care managers received supervision from a psychiatrist . 
<br> MAIN MEASURES PTSD symptom severity was the primary outcome . Depression , functioning , perceived quality of care , utilization , and costs were secondary outcomes . 
<br> KEY RESULTS There were no differences between <font color="red">3CM_1</font> and <font color="red">usual_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> in symptoms or functioning . Participants assigned to <font color="red">3CM_2</font> were more likely to have a mental health visit , fill an antidepressant prescription , and have adequate antidepressant refills . <font color="red">3CM_2</font> participants also had more mental health visits and higher outpatient pharmacy costs . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the need for careful examination of the way that <font color="red">collaborative_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> models are implemented for treating PTSD , and for additional supports to encourage primary care providers to manage PTSD .
