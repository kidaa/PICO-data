<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Although collaborative care is effective for treating depression and other mental disorders in primary care , there have been no randomized trials of collaborative care specifically for patients with Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare a collaborative approach , <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">Three_2</font> <font color="red">Component_2</font> <font color="red">Model_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">3CM_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">usual_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> for treating PTSD in primary care . 
<br> DESIGN The study was a two - arm , parallel randomized clinical trial . PTSD patients were recruited from five primary care clinics at four Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities and randomized to <font color="red">receive_1</font> <font color="red">usual_3</font> <font color="red">care_3</font> <font color="red">or_3</font> <font color="red">usual_3</font> <font color="red">care_3</font> <font color="red">plus_3</font> <font color="red">3CM_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font> Blinded assessors collected data at baseline and 3-month and 6-month follow - up . 
<br> PARTICIPANTS Participants were 195 Veterans . Their average age was 45 years , 91% were male , 58% were white , 40% served in Iraq or Afghanistan , and 42% served in Vietnam . 
<br> INTERVENTION All participants received <font color="red">usual_2</font> <font color="red">care_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Participants assigned to <font color="red">3CM_2</font> <font color="red">also_1</font> <font color="red">received_1</font> <font color="red">telephone_2</font> <font color="red">care_2</font> <font color="red">management_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Care_1</font> <font color="red">managers_1</font> <font color="red">received_1</font> <font color="red">supervision_2</font> <font color="red">from_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">psychiatrist_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">
<br>_1</font> MAIN MEASURES PTSD symptom severity was the primary outcome . Depression , functioning , perceived quality of care , utilization , and costs were secondary outcomes . 
<br> KEY RESULTS There were no differences between 3CM and usual care in symptoms or functioning . Participants assigned to <font color="red">3CM_1</font> were more likely to have a mental health visit , fill an antidepressant prescription , and have adequate antidepressant refills . <font color="red">3CM_1</font> participants also had more mental health visits and higher outpatient pharmacy costs . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the need for careful examination of the way that collaborative care models are implemented for treating PTSD , and for additional supports to encourage primary care providers to manage PTSD .
