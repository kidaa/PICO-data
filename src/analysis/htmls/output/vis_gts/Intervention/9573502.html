<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Human_4</font> <font color="red">brain_4</font> <font color="red">natriuretic_4</font> <font color="red">peptide_4</font> <font color="red">(_3</font> <font color="red">hBNP_4</font> <font color="red">)_4</font> is a promising agent for the treatment of decompensated cardiac failure . However , the systemic hemodynamic , neurohormonal , and renal effects of <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> have been incompletely studied in human heart failure . 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS The effects of a continuous 4-hour <font color="red">infusion_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> were determined in 16 decompensated heart failure patients in an invasive , randomized , double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_3</font> <font color="red">-_3</font> controlled study . Patients were evaluated during three 4-hour study periods : baseline , treatment ( <font color="red">placebo_5</font> [ n = 4 ] versus <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> 0.025 or 0.05 microgram / kg / min [ n = 12 ] ) , and post - treatment . Urinary volume losses were replaced hourly to separate the vasodilatory and diuretic effects of <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font> Two patients in the <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> group were excluded from the analysis because of adverse events . <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> significantly ( P < .001 ) reduced right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by approximately 30% and 40% , respectively . <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> also significantly lowered systemic vascular resistance from 1722 + /- 139 to 1101 + /- 83 dynes.s.cm-5 ( P < .05 ) . These unloading effects of <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> produced a 28% increase in cardiac index ( P < .05 ) with no change in heart rate . Compared to <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> decreased plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone . Renal hemodynamics were unaffected by <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> <font color="red">;_3</font> however , most patients were resistant to its natriuretic effect . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS 1 ) The predominant hemodynamic effects of <font color="red">hBNP_2</font> were a decrease in cardiac preload and systemic vascular resistance . 2 ) <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> also improved cardiac output without increasing heart rate . 3 ) Plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone levels decreased during <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> <font color="red">infusion_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 4 ) <font color="red">hBNP_3</font> is pharmacologically active and has potential in the <font color="red">therapy_1</font> for decompensated heart failure .
