<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Children with autism have difficulties in emotion recognition and a number of interventions have been designed to target these problems . However , few emotion training interventions have been trialled with young children with autism and co - morbid ID . This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an <font color="red">emotion_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">programme_2</font> for a group of young children with autism with a range of intellectual ability . 
<br> METHODS Participants were 55 children with autistic disorder , aged 4 - 7 years ( FSIQ 42 - 107 ) . Children were randomly assigned to an intervention ( n = 28 ) or control group ( n = 27 ) . Participants in the intervention group watched a <font color="red">DVD_2</font> <font color="red">designed_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">teach_2</font> <font color="red">emotion_2</font> <font color="red">recognition_2</font> <font color="red">skills_2</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">autism_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">Transporters_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> whereas the control group watched a <font color="red">DVD_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">Thomas_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">Tank_2</font> <font color="red">Engine_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Participants were assessed on their ability to complete basic emotion recognition tasks , mindreading and theory of mind ( TOM ) tasks before and after the 4-week intervention period , and at 3-month follow - up . 
<br> RESULTS Analyses controlled for the effect of chronological age , verbal intelligence , gender and DVD viewing time on outcomes . Children in the intervention group showed improved performance in the recognition of anger compared with the control group , with few improvements maintained at 3-month follow - up . There was no generalisation of skills to TOM or social skills . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The <font color="red">Transporters_1</font> <font color="red">programme_1</font> showed limited efficacy in teaching basic emotion recognition skills to young children with autism with a lower range of cognitive ability . Improvements were limited to the recognition of expressions of anger , with poor maintenance of these skills at follow - up . These findings provide limited support for the efficacy of the <font color="red">Transporters_1</font> <font color="red">programme_1</font> for young children with autism of a lower cognitive range .
