<br> OBJECTIVE To examine the efficacy of a <font color="red">modular_1</font> <font color="red">cognitive_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">behavioral_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">CBT_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">protocol_1</font> relative to <font color="red">treatment_2</font> <font color="red">as_2</font> <font color="red">usual_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">TAU_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> among children with high - functioning autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and clinically significant anxiety . 
<br> METHOD A total of 45 children ( 7 - 11 years of age ) with high - functioning ASD and clinically significant anxiety were randomized to receive 16 sessions of weekly <font color="red">CBT_2</font> or <font color="red">TAU_2</font> for an equivalent duration . After screening , assessments were conducted at baseline , post - treatment , and 3-month follow - up . Raters were blind to treatment condition . 
<br> RESULTS Youth receiving <font color="red">CBT_2</font> showed substantial improvement relative to <font color="red">TAU_2</font> on primary anxiety outcomes . Of 24 children randomized to the <font color="red">CBT_2</font> arm , 18 ( 75% ) were treatment responders , versus only 3 of 21 children ( 14% ) in the <font color="red">TAU_2</font> arm . Gains were generally maintained at 3-month follow - up for <font color="red">CBT_2</font> responders . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Relative to <font color="red">usual_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">CBT_2</font> adapted for anxious youth with high - functioning ASD demonstrates large effects in reducing anxiety symptoms . This study contributes to the growing literature supporting adapted <font color="red">CBT_2</font> approaches for treating anxiety in youth with ASD .
