<br> PURPOSE Recently , new <font color="red">custom_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">fit_2</font> <font color="red">pin_2</font> <font color="red">guides_2</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">knee_1</font> <font color="red">arthroplasty_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">TKA_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> have been introduced . Use of these guides may reduce operating time . Use of the guides combined with the absence of intramedullary alignment jigs may lead to reduced blood loss and improved early outcomes . Our aim was to evaluate blood loss and early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing <font color="red">minimally_1</font> <font color="red">invasive_1</font> <font color="red">TKA_1</font> <font color="red">using_1</font> <font color="red">custom_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">fit_2</font> <font color="red">magnetic_2</font> <font color="red">resonance_2</font> <font color="red">imaging_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">MRI)-based_2</font> <font color="red">pin_2</font> <font color="red">guides_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS A prospective study in 80 patients was carried out . Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups . In one group , <font color="red">intramedullary_2</font> <font color="red">alignment_2</font> <font color="red">jigs_2</font> were used . In the second group , <font color="red">custom_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">fit_2</font> <font color="red">MRI_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">based_2</font> <font color="red">pin_2</font> <font color="red">guides_2</font> were used . All patients received the same cemented posterior - stabilized implant through a mini - midvastus approach . The volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. Hb loss was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative Hb level . Transfusion requirements and surgical time were recorded . Outcome measures were Knee Society Scores ( KSS ) , knee flexion , knee swelling and pain . 
<br> RESULTS There was lower mean drainage of blood in the <font color="red">custom_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">fit_1</font> group ( 391 ml vs. 603 ml ; p < 0.0001 ) . There was no difference in estimated loss of Hb ( 3.6 g / dl vs. 4.1 g / dl ; n.s . ) and in transfusion requirements ( 7.5 % vs. 10 % ; n.s . ) . Surgical time was reduced in the <font color="red">custom_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">fit_1</font> group ( 12 min less ; p = 0.001 ) . KSS measured at week 2 , 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups . Knee flexion measured on days 7 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 and knee swelling and pain measured on days 1 , 3 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 showed no significant difference between groups . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Using <font color="red">custom_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">fit_2</font> <font color="red">pin_2</font> <font color="red">guides_2</font> reduces blood drainage , but not the estimated Hb loss in minimally invasive TKA and does not affect transfusion rate . Surgical time is reduced . There is no effect on the early clinical outcomes .
