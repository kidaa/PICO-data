Prevention of spinal anesthesia - induced hypotension in the elderly : comparison between preanesthetic administration of <font color="red">crystalloids_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">colloids_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">no_1</font> <font color="red">prehydration_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>

<br> The practice of routinely prehydrating patients by infusing a crystalloid or colloid solution ( up to 1.0 L/70 kg ) for prevention of spinal anesthesia - induced hypotension has been challenged recently , after several reports of failure to demonstrate its efficacy in young women . We compared the incidence and frequency of hypotension and vasopressor therapy after spinal anesthesia and <font color="red">no_1</font> <font color="red">prehydration_1</font> with <font color="red">crystalloid_1</font> and <font color="red">colloid_1</font> <font color="red">prehydration_1</font> in elderly patients . Eighty - five ASA grade I or II patients ( aged 60 - 89 yr ) for elective total hip replacement were randomized to receive 500 mL <font color="red">crystalloid_1</font> <font color="red">solution_1</font> ( Hartmanns , n = 29 ) , 500 mL <font color="red">colloid_1</font> ( Haemaccel , n = 28 ) , or <font color="red">no_1</font> <font color="red">prehydration_1</font> ( n = 28 ) over 10 min prior to spinal anesthesia . Hypotension was defined as a 30% decrease from baseline systolic blood pressure ( BP ) or systolic < 90 mm Hg , and was treated with ephedrine 3-mg boluses . Although absolute systolic BP readings were significantly higher in the <font color="red">colloid_1</font> group between 6 and 30 min ( P < 0.05 ) , the incidence of hypotension was not significantly different between the groups . The incidence of ephedrine use , incidence of nausea / vomiting , and median total dose of ephedrine were similar in all groups . We conclude that , in elderly patients undergoing elective procedures , <font color="red">withholding_1</font> <font color="red">prehydration_1</font> is not associated with any greater degree of hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy compared with <font color="red">crystalloid_1</font> or <font color="red">colloid_1</font> <font color="red">prehydration_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
