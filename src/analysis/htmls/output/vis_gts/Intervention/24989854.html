A randomized controlled study of a <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> for preadolescent children with autism spectrum disorders : generalization of skills by training parents and teachers ? 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Social_2</font> <font color="red">skills_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">SST_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) to improve their social and communication skills . Despite the fact that <font color="red">SSTs_1</font> are often applied in clinical practice , the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive . Moreover , long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated . Additionally , there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of <font color="red">SST_1</font> and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life . We expect parent and teacher involvement in <font color="red">SST_2</font> to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life . 
<br> METHOD / DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with three conditions , 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school ( 10 - 12 years of calendar age ) have been randomized to <font color="red">SST_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">SST_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">PTI_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">SST_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">Parent_2</font> <font color="red">&_2</font> <font color="red">Teacher_2</font> <font color="red">Involvement_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> or <font color="red">care_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">as_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">usual_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The <font color="red">SST_1</font> consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children . In the <font color="red">SST_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">PTI_2</font> condition , parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments . Assessment takes place at three moments : before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow - up . Primary outcome is socialization , as an aspect of adaptive functioning . Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during <font color="red">SST_2</font> and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi - informant perspective . Additionally , possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed . 
<br> DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating <font color="red">SST_2</font> in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range ( 10 - 12 years ) . Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol , application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments , use of multiple raters , investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life , and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow - up measures at 6 months after the end of training .
