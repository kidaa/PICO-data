Effects of <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> on clinic and ambulatory blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients . Collaborative Group of the Primary Prevention Project ( PPP)--Hypertension study .

<br> <font color="red">Nonsteroidal_1</font> <font color="red">antiinflammatory_1</font> <font color="red">drugs_1</font> may affect blood pressure ( BP ) control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment , but data on the effects of <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> are scanty . This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">doses_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> ( 100 mg / day ) on clinic and ambulatory systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic ( DBP ) BP in hypertensives on chronic , stable antihypertensive therapy . The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project ( PPP ) , a randomized , controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors . Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients ( 76 men , 66 women ; mean age 59 + /- 5.9 years ) treated with different antihypertensive drugs : 71 patients were randomized to <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> and 71 served as <font color="red">controls_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring , at baseline and after 3 months of <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects . Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> were similar to baseline : deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg ( 95% confidence intervals [ CI ] from -1.9 to + 2.9 mm Hg ) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg ( 95% CI from -2.5 to + 0.3 mm Hg ) . The pattern was similar in the <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> No interaction was found between <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> and the most used antihypertensive drug classes ( angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists ) . Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">aspirin_2</font> on BP control in hypertensives under treatment .
