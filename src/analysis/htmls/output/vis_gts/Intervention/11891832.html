Comparison of weakness progression in inclusion body myositis during treatment with <font color="red">methotrexate_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> We investigated whether 5 to 20 mg per week oral <font color="red">methotrexate_2</font> could slow down disease progression in 44 patients with inclusion body myositis in a randomized double - blind <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> controlled study over 48 weeks . Mean change of quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores was the primary study outcome measure . Quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores declined in both treatment groups , -0.2% for <font color="red">methotrexate_2</font> and -3.4% for <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( 95% confidence interval = -2.5% to + 9.1% for difference ) . There were also no differences in manual muscle testing sum scores , activity scale scores and patients ' own assessments after 48 weeks of treatment . Serum creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in the <font color="red">methotrexate_2</font> group . We conclude that oral <font color="red">methotrexate_2</font> did not slow down progression of muscle weakness but decreased serum creatine kinase activity .
