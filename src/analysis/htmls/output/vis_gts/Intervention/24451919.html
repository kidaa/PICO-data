Inverse Effect of <font color="red">Fluoxetine_2</font> on Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Reward Reversal in ADHD and Autism . 
<br>
<br> Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive flexibility . Serotonin is involved in both disorders , and <font color="red">selective_1</font> <font color="red">serotonin_1</font> <font color="red">reuptake_1</font> <font color="red">inhibitors_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">SSRIs_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> can modulate cognitive flexibility and improve behavior in both disorders . Thus , this study investigates shared and disorder - specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal , and the acute effects of an <font color="red">SSRI_1</font> on these . Age - matched boys with ADHD ( 15 ) , ASD ( 18 ) , and controls ( 21 ) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) during a reversal task . Patients were scanned twice , under either an acute dose of <font color="red">Fluoxetine_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> in a double - blind , placebo - controlled randomized design . Repeated - measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects . Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects . fMRI data showed that , under <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) , compared with control and ADHD boys . Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation . Under <font color="red">Fluoxetine_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> mPFC activation was up - regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls , but down - regulated in ADHD boys relative to <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD . <font color="red">Fluoxetine_2</font> therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning , suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities .
