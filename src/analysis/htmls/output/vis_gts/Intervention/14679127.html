Long - term survival in a phase III , randomised study of <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> versus <font color="red">paclitaxel_2</font> in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND We have continued to monitor the survival of patients randomised in a previously reported multicentre phase III study of <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> versus <font color="red">paclitaxel_2</font> in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who had failed one prior platinum - based regimen . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were randomised to <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> ( 1.5 mg / m(2)/day for 5 days ) or <font color="red">paclitaxel_2</font> ( 175 mg / m(2)/day as a 3-h infusion ) every 21 days . Patients were eligible for treatment with the alternate therapy at third line . The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life ( EORTC QOL)-C30 questionnaire was also used to measure eight symptoms at baseline and during each course ( pain , anorexia , diarrhoea , fatigue , nausea and vomiting , dyspnea , constipation and insomnia ) . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 226 patients were evaluable for response . Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups , as were results of the EORTC QOL-30 questionnaire . For the <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> group , median time to progression was 18.9 weeks ( range < 1 to 92.6 + weeks ; 25% censored ) , and , for <font color="red">paclitaxel_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> 14.7 weeks ( range < 1 to 137.3 + weeks ; 12.3% censored ) ; P = 0.076 . At 4 years post - randomisation , median survival in the <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> group was 63.0 weeks ( range < 1 to 238.4 + weeks ; 20.5% censored ) and , for <font color="red">paclitaxel_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> 53.0 weeks ( range < 1 to 226.3 + weeks ; 12.3% censored ) ; P = 0.44 . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">Topotecan_2</font> continues to demonstrate comparable efficacy and survival to <font color="red">paclitaxel_2</font> with manageable and non - cumulative haematological toxicity . Non - haematological toxicity was generally mild for both groups . The long - term survival rate indicates substantial therapeutic benefit for this group of patients receiving <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> at relapse of ovarian cancer .
