[ The <font color="red">chemotherapy_4</font> of advanced breast cancer . A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study ( 1974 - 1977 ) ( author 's transl ) ] . 
<br>
<br> The authors explain the objectives and the structure of a programme evolved for the methodic study of advanced breast cancers which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the departments of medicine in eight French anticancer centres . They analyse the initial phases , which correspond to the three first years of work . They give the state of the results that have been obtained in 603 patients using three protocols for treatment . These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of <font color="red">chemotherapy_3</font> which consisted of <font color="red">vincristine_4</font> <font color="red">associated_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">one_1</font> <font color="red">part_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">cyclophosphamide_5</font> <font color="red">and_3</font> <font color="red">5-fluoro_5</font> <font color="red">-_5</font> <font color="red">uracil_5</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">other_1</font> <font color="red">hand_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">doxorubicine_5</font> <font color="red">or_5</font> <font color="red">/_5</font> <font color="red">and_5</font> <font color="red">with_5</font> <font color="red">methotrexate_5</font> <font color="red">._5</font> From this study there emerged the value of <font color="red">combined_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">using_2</font> <font color="red">doxorubicine_4</font> as much because of the frequency with which results better than 50% were obtained ( in a randomised trial ) as by their quality , which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases . They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all <font color="red">complex_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> which aims as much at palliation as at cure , and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of <font color="red">chemotherapy_2</font> in order to ensure its development as an <font color="red">anticancer_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
