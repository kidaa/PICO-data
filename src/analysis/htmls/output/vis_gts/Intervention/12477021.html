Clinical performance of the <font color="red">Reichert_1</font> <font color="red">AT550_1</font> <font color="red">:_1</font> a new non - contact tonometer . 
<br>
<br> The aim of the present study was to assess the level of accuracy for measurements of intra - ocular pressure ( IOP ) obtained with a new <font color="red">non_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">contact_1</font> <font color="red">tonometer_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">NCT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">Reichert_1</font> <font color="red">AT550_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Measurements were compared against those obtained with the <font color="red">Reichert_1</font> <font color="red">Xpert_1</font> <font color="red">Plus_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Goldmann_1</font> <font color="red">applanation_1</font> <font color="red">tonometer_1</font> and <font color="red">Perkins_1</font> <font color="red">tonometer_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Thirty - five university students were assessed with the four tonometers in a randomised order , with non - contact tonometry performed first . Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer . Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained . No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the <font color="red">AT550_1</font> <font color="red">NCT_1</font> with contact applanation tonometry ( AT ) ( p > 0.05 ) , displaying the closest level of agreement ( as represented by the lowest mean difference and the narrowest confidence interval ) with the <font color="red">Goldmann_1</font> <font color="red">tonometer_1</font> ( limits of agreement , 0.12+/-2.17 ) . In conclusion , readings of IOP with the <font color="red">AT550_1</font> <font color="red">NCT_1</font> are clinically comparable with those obtained with <font color="red">Goldmann_1</font> <font color="red">tonometry_1</font> in a population with IOP within the normal range .
