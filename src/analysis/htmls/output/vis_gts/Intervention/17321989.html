The prophylactic effect of <font color="red">itraconazole_2</font> capsules and <font color="red">fluconazole_2</font> capsules for systemic fungal infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes : a Japanese multicenter randomized , controlled study . 
<br>
<br> We performed a randomized , controlled study comparing the prophylactic effects of capsule forms of <font color="red">fluconazole_2</font> ( n = 110 ) and <font color="red">itraconazole_2</font> ( n = 108 ) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) during and after chemotherapy . There were 4 cases with possible systemic fungal infection in the <font color="red">itraconazole_2</font> group , and there were 8 possible and 3 probable cases in the <font color="red">fluconazole_2</font> group . Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups . In patients with MDS or in the remission - induction phase of chemotherapy , the numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the <font color="red">itraconazole_2</font> group than in the <font color="red">fluconazole_2</font> group , whereas no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of therapy . In patients with neutrophil counts of > 0.1 x 10(9)/L lasting for more than 4 weeks , the frequency of infection in the <font color="red">fluconazole_2</font> group ( 5 of 9 patients ) was significantly higher than in the <font color="red">itraconazole_2</font> group ( 0 of 7 patients ; P = .03 ) . Our results suggest that both drugs were well tolerated in patients with AML or MDS who received chemotherapy and that the efficacy of <font color="red">itraconazole_2</font> for prophylaxis against systemic fungal disease is not inferior to that of <font color="red">fluconazole_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
