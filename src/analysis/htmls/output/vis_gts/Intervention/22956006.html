A randomized double - blind placebo - controlled cross - over trial of the impact on quality of life of continuing <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> beyond 24   h following adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . 
<br>
<br> Uncertainty remains about the optimal <font color="red">anti_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">emetic_1</font> <font color="red">regimen_1</font> for control of delayed nausea and vomiting after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . Many patients receive <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> but complain of insomnia , anxiety / agitation , and indigestion . The aim was to determine if patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer prefer treatment with <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> for prophylaxis against delayed nausea and vomiting , and to compare quality of life ( QOL ) between the two treatments . In this randomized , double - blind , cross - over trial , we compared oral <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> ( 4   mg twice daily for 2   days ) versus <font color="red">placebo_2</font> for chemotherapy - naïve patients with breast cancer . All patients received intravenous granisetron and <font color="red">dexamethasone_1</font> pre - chemotherapy and oral granisetron on day 2 . Primary endpoints were : ( i ) patient preference ; ( ii ) difference between cycles in change of QOL from days 1 to 8 . Median age of the 94 women was 51   years ( range 27 - 76 ) : 79 received fluorouracil / epirubicin / cyclophosphamide and 15 received doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide . Thirteen withdrew pre - cycle 2 with no differences between arms . Of 80 patients stating a preference , 31 preferred <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( 39   % , 95   % CI : 28 - 50   % ) and 37 ( 46   % , 95   % CI : 35 - 58   % ) preferred <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> <font color="red">;_2</font> 12 had no preference . There were no differences in intensity of vomiting , nausea , or time to onset of vomiting . There was greater decrease in global QOL ( p   =   0.06 ) when patients received <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> No other symptom / QOL domains differed significantly . In conclusion , no significant difference was found in patient preference , QOL , or symptoms regardless of whether <font color="red">dexamethasone_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> was used after adjuvant chemotherapy .
