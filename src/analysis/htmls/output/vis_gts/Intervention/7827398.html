<br>
<br> Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in developed countries . The incidence of stroke increases exponentially with age , yet , traditionally , many medical practitioners have been reluctant to treat hypertension in older patients . Since 1991 , the results of 3 major trials -- the British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) trial of treatment in older adults , the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with <font color="red">Hypertension_1</font> ( STOP - Hypertension ) and the <font color="red">Systolic_1</font> <font color="red">Hypertension_1</font> in the Elderly Program ( SHEP)--have conclusively established the benefits of treating older patients ( > 60 years ) with both <font color="red">diastolic_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">isolated_2</font> <font color="red">systolic_2</font> <font color="red">hypertension_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> International guidelines for the management of hypertension -- including the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee , the 1993 report of the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension and the second report of the British Hypertension Society Working Party -- have all been modified to reflect the emerging evidence concerning the benefits of treating older patients . Cost - effectiveness data are similarly in accord with giving high priority to the treatment of older individuals with <font color="red">hypertension_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
