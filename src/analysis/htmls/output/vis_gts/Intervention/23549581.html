Effect of <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> on pain , function , and quality of life among patients with chemotherapy - induced painful peripheral neuropathy : a randomized clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> IMPORTANCE There are no known effective treatments for painful chemotherapy - induced peripheral neuropathy . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of <font color="red">duloxetine_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 60 mg daily , on average pain severity . 
<br> DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized , double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> controlled crossover trial at 8 National Cancer Institute ( NCI)-funded cooperative research networks that enrolled 231 patients who were 25 years or older being treated at community and academic settings between April 2008 and March 2011 . Study follow - up was completed July 2012 . Stratified by chemotherapeutic drug and comorbid pain risk , patients were randomized to receive either <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> followed by <font color="red">placebo_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> followed by <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Eligibility required that patients have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 , representing average chemotherapy - induced pain , after paclitaxel , other taxane , or oxaliplatin treatment . 
<br> INTERVENTIONS The initial treatment consisted of taking 1 capsule daily of either 30 mg of <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> for the first week and 2 capsules of either 30 mg of <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> daily for 4 additional weeks . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary hypothesis was that <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> would be more effective than <font color="red">placebo_2</font> in decreasing chemotherapy - induced peripheral neuropathic pain . Pain severity was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form " average pain " item with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing as bad as can be imagined . 
<br> RESULTS Individuals receiving <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> as their initial 5-week treatment reported a mean decrease in average pain of 1.06 ( 95% CI , 0.72 - 1.40 ) vs 0.34 ( 95% CI , 0.01 - 0.66 ) among those who received <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( P = .003 ; effect size , 0.513 ) . The observed mean difference in the average pain score between <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> and <font color="red">placebo_2</font> was 0.73 ( 95% CI , 0.26 - 1.20 ) . Fifty - nine percent of those initially receiving <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> vs 38% of those initially receiving <font color="red">placebo_2</font> reported decreased pain of any amount . 
<br> CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among patients with painful chemotherapy - induced peripheral neuropathy , the use of <font color="red">duloxetine_2</font> compared with <font color="red">placebo_2</font> for 5 weeks resulted in a greater reduction in pain .
