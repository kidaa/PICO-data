<font color="red">Salbutamol_2</font> or <font color="red">mist_1</font> in acute bronchiolitis . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The role of <font color="red">bronchodilators_1</font> in the treatment of bronchiolitis remains controversial . 
<br> METHODS A double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> controlled trial was performed to evaluate the clinical response to <font color="red">nebulized_1</font> <font color="red">salbutamol_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> One hundred and fifty - six infants aged between 7 weeks and 24 months who had had an episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomized to three groups as follows : ( i ) <font color="red">nebulized_1</font> <font color="red">salbutamol_2</font> was administered to 52 patients in group I at a dose of 0.15 mg / kg in 2 mL saline ; ( ii ) <font color="red">saline_2</font> was nebulized to 52 patients in group II and ( iii ) in group III 52 patients received <font color="red">mist_1</font> in a tent . All three groups were administered oxygen during the procedures . Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 min if the respiratory score was 5 or more . Respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation and presence of cyanosis , wheezing , retractions were recorded before and after each treatment . 
<br> RESULTS The decrease in the respiratory score was 5.2 + /- 1.8 , 0.82 + /- 2.4 and 1.7 + /- 1.3 in group I , II and III , respectively . The decrease in group I was significantly higher than in the other groups . Heart rate was similar between groups . Oxygen saturation decreased in group I without reaching statistical significance . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">Salbutamol_2</font> was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis .
