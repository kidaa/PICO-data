[ Postural biofeedback and locomotion reeducation in stroke patients ] . 
<br>
<br> AIMS To compare , in post - acute hemiparetic patients , gait improvement after <font color="red">conventional_2</font> <font color="red">physical_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">alone_1</font> or with a <font color="red">specialised_2</font> <font color="red">balance_2</font> <font color="red">retraining_2</font> <font color="red">program_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> PATIENTS Twenty - six patients within 3 months of onset of stroke were randomised to receive <font color="red">physical_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">control_2</font> <font color="red">group_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> or <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">retraining_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">experimental_2</font> <font color="red">group_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> most of the patients in both groups with left hemiplegia . The experimental group was significantly older than the control group . 
<br> METHOD Thirteen patients received <font color="red">early_1</font> <font color="red">conventional_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and 13 received <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">combined_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">standing_2</font> <font color="red">balance_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">by_2</font> <font color="red">biofeedback_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">BPM_2</font> <font color="red">Monitor_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Clinical measures were collected at entry ( J0 ) , once when subjects began to walk ( JM ) and 30 days later ( JM + 30 ) . Gait spatiotemporal parameters were collected by use of the Vicon system at JM and JM + 30 . 
<br> RESULTS Whatever the method of rehabilitation , the clinical scores improved significantly between J0 and JM + 30 , except for spasticity . The time between stroke and the beginning of walking was not significantly different between both groups . Gait velocity increased significantly between JM and JM + 30 in both groups , with no difference between groups . The walking pattern was improved for both groups , with a significant increase of the duration of the paretic limb single stance . The experimental group significantly improved the duration of the reception double stance on the paretic limb between JM and JM + 30 compared with the control group ( P = 0.03 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Both groups demonstrated improvement in the rehabilitation unit . The benefits of <font color="red">visual_1</font> <font color="red">biofeedback_1</font> by forceplate system training suggest particular improvement of anticipation equilibrium with <font color="red">conventional_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
