The effect of <font color="red">weight_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> on bone mineral density and bone turnover in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors with bone loss : a 24-month randomized controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> SUMMARY This study examined whether <font color="red">24_1</font> <font color="red">months_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">weight_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">exercises_2</font> enhanced the effectiveness of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D in maintaining or improving bone mineral density ( BMD ) in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors . Subjects who were > or = 50% adherent to <font color="red">exercise_1</font> had no improvement in BMD but were less likely to lose BMD . 
<br> INTRODUCTION This study examined whether ( 1 ) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors ( BCS ) with bone loss taking 24 months of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D had increased bone mineral density ( BMD ) at the total hip , femoral neck , L1-L4 spine , total radius and 33% radius , and decreased bone turnover ; ( 2 ) subjects who also participated in <font color="red">strength_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">weight_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">exercises_1</font> had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover ; and ( 3 ) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve ( at least maintain ) BMD . 
<br> METHODS Postmenopausal BCS ( 223 ) were randomly assigned to <font color="red">exercise_2</font> <font color="red">plus_2</font> <font color="red">medication_2</font> or <font color="red">medication_2</font> <font color="red">only_1</font> groups . Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly , and the exercise group additionally had <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">exercises_1</font> twice weekly . 
<br> RESULTS After 24 months , women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip ( + 1.81% ) and spine ( + 2.85% ) and significant decreases in Alkphase B ( -8.7% ) and serum NTx ( -16.7% ) . Women who also exercised had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck ( + 0.29% ) , total hip ( + 0.34% ) , spine ( + 0.23% ) , total radius ( + 0.30% ) , and additional decreases in Alkphase B ( -2.4% ) and Serum NTx ( -6.5% ) . Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with exercise were not significant . Subjects who were > or = 50% adherent to <font color="red">exercise_1</font> were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.66 , p = 0.03 ) and femoral neck ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.63 , p = 0.03 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">Strength_2</font> <font color="red">/_2</font> <font color="red">weight_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">exercises_2</font> may prevent loss of BMD in postmenopausal BCS at risk for bone loss .
