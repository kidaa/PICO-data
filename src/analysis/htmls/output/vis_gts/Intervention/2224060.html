Randomized controlled study of <font color="red">chemoimmunotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">bestatin_3</font> of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in adults . 
<br>
<br> A new <font color="red">immunomodulating_1</font> <font color="red">agent_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">bestatin_3</font> ( INN : Ubenimex has low toxicity even after long - term oral administration and has significant modifications in immunological response . A cooperative randomized controlled study of <font color="red">bestatin_3</font> <font color="red">immunotherapy_2</font> in combination with <font color="red">remission_2</font> <font color="red">maintenance_2</font> <font color="red">chemotherapy_2</font> for adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( ANLL ) was performed . After induction of complete remission , patients were randomized to the <font color="red">bestatin_4</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( 30 mg / bw per os ( po ) daily ) and the <font color="red">control_2</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The 101 eligible cases ( bestatin : 48 , control : 53 ) were analyzed ; the <font color="red">bestatin_1</font> group achieved longer remission than the control group and a statistically significant longer survival . Though this prolongation of remission was not significant in the <font color="red">bestatin_1</font> group compared to the control group in the 15 - 49 yr age group , in the 50 - 65 yr age group it was significantly longer . <font color="red">Bestatin_3</font> is shown to be a clinically useful drug for <font color="red">immunotherapy_1</font> of adult ANLL , since it has prolonged survival and remission especially in elderly patients , with few side - effects .
