A New <font color="red">Interactive_1</font> <font color="red">Screening_1</font> <font color="red">Test_1</font> for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Toddlers . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To develop a clinically valid interactive level 2 screening assessment for autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) in toddlers that is brief , easily administered , and scored by clinicians . 
<br> STUDY DESIGN We describe the development , training , standardization , and validation of the <font color="red">Rapid_5</font> <font color="red">Interactive_5</font> <font color="red">Screening_5</font> <font color="red">Test_5</font> <font color="red">for_2</font> <font color="red">Autism_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">Toddlers_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">RITA_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">T_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> with ASD - specific diagnostic instruments . The <font color="red">RITA_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">T_1</font> can be administered and scored in 10 minutes . We studied the validity of the <font color="red">RITA_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">T_2</font> to distinguish between toddlers with ASD from toddlers with developmental delay ( DD)/non - ASD in an early childhood clinic . We also evaluated the test 's performance in toddlers with no developmental concerns . We identified a cutoff score based on sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive value of the <font color="red">RITA_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">T_2</font> that best differentiates between ASD and DD / non - ASD . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 61 toddlers were enrolled . <font color="red">RITA_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">T_2</font> scores were correlated with ASD - specific diagnostic tools ( r = 0.79 ; P < .01 ) and ASD clinical diagnoses ( r = 0.77 ; P < .01 ) . Mean scores were significantly different in subjects with ASD , those with DD / non - ASD , and those with no developmental concerns ( 20.8 vs 13 vs 10.6 , respectively ; P < .0001 ) . At a cutoff score of > 14 , the <font color="red">RITA_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">T_1</font> had a sensitivity of 1.00 , specificity of 0.84 , and positive predictive value of 0.88 for identifying ASD risk in a high - risk group . 
<br> CONCLUSION The <font color="red">RITA_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">T_2</font> is a promising new <font color="red">level_1</font> <font color="red">2_1</font> <font color="red">interactive_1</font> <font color="red">screening_1</font> tool for improving the early identification of ASD in toddlers in general pediatric and early intervention settings and allowing access to treatment .
