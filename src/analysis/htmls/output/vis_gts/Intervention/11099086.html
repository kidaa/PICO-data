<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Acute invasive diarrhea is a potentially serious condition in children . Because of the increasing resistance of enteric pathogens to commonly used <font color="red">oral_1</font> <font color="red">antibiotics_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">intramuscular_1</font> <font color="red">ceftriaxone_3</font> has become the routine drug in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea requiring an emergency visit in southern Israel . The inconvenience of this parenteral regimen created an increased need for <font color="red">oral_1</font> <font color="red">pediatric_1</font> <font color="red">formulations_1</font> for the treatment of invasive diarrhea . 
<br> OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a suspension formulation of <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_3</font> in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in infants and children . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1996 through December 1997 , 201 evaluable children ages 6 months to 10 years ( 35% < 1 year ; 70% <3 years ) presenting with acute invasive diarrhea at the Pediatric Emergency Room were randomized to receive either <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_5</font> <font color="red">suspension_2</font> ( 10 mg / kg twice a day + i m <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">;_2</font> n = 95 ) or <font color="red">i_2</font> <font color="red">m_2</font> <font color="red">ceftriaxone_5</font> ( 50 mg / kg / day + <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">suspension_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> n = 106 ) for 3 days in a double blind manner . Stool cultures for Shigella , Salmonella , Campylobacter spp . and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were obtained on Days 1 , 3 , 4 to 5 and 21 + /- 5 . Clinical response and safety were assessed on Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to 5 and 21 + /- 5 . 
<br> RESULTS We isolated 127 pathogens from 121 ( 60% ) patients : 73 ( 57% ) Shigella ; 23 ( 18% ) Salmonella ; 18 ( 14% ) E. coli ; and 13 ( 10% ) Campylobacter . Overall bacteriologic eradication on Day 4 to 5 was 99% for Shigella , 77% for Salmonella and 77% for Campylobacter , with no difference between the 2 groups . Clinical cure or improvement was observed in 100 and 99% of the <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">ceftriaxone_2</font> groups , respectively . <font color="red">Serum_1</font> <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_2</font> values determined on Day 3 of the treatment were higher in the majority of patients than were the MIC50 and MIC90 values for the Shigella and Salmonella spp . isolated . Possible drug - related adverse events occurred in 13 patients [ <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> 8 ( 8% ) ; <font color="red">ceftriaxone_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 5 ( 4.7% ) ] and were mild and transient . Joint examination was normal during and after completion of <font color="red">therapy_1</font> in all patients . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">Oral_1</font> <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_2</font> was as safe and effective as <font color="red">intramuscular_1</font> <font color="red">ceftriaxone_2</font> for the <font color="red">empiric_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> of acute invasive diarrhea in ambulatory pediatric patients requiring an emergency room visit .
