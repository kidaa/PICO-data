<br> BACKGROUND A large body of evidence suggests that fine particulate matter ( PM ) air pollution is a cause of cardiovascular disease , but little is known in particular about the cardiovascular effects of <font color="red">indoor_1</font> <font color="red">air_1</font> <font color="red">pollution_1</font> <font color="red">from_1</font> <font color="red">household_1</font> <font color="red">use_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">solid_1</font> <font color="red">fuels_1</font> in developing countries . RESPIRE ( Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects ) was a randomized trial of a <font color="red">chimney_1</font> <font color="red">woodstove_1</font> that reduces <font color="red">wood_1</font> <font color="red">smoke_1</font> <font color="red">exposure_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> OBJECTIVES We tested the hypotheses that the <font color="red">stove_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> compared with open fire use , would reduce ST - segment depression and increase heart rate variability ( HRV ) . 
<br> METHODS We used two complementary study designs : a ) between - groups comparisons based on <font color="red">randomized_1</font> <font color="red">stove_2</font> <font color="red">assignment_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and b ) before - and - after comparisons within control subjects who <font color="red">used_1</font> <font color="red">open_1</font> <font color="red">fires_1</font> <font color="red">during_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">trial_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">received_1</font> <font color="red">chimney_2</font> <font color="red">stoves_2</font> <font color="red">after_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">trial_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among 49 intervention and 70 control women 38 - 84 years of age , and 55 control subjects were also assessed after receiving stoves . HRV and ST - segment values were assessed for each 30-min period . ST - segment depression was defined as an average value below -1.00 mm . Personal fine PM [ aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm ( PM₂.₅ ] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram . 
<br> RESULTS PM₂.₅ exposure means were 266 and 102 μg / m³ during the trial period in the control and intervention groups , respectively . During the trial , the <font color="red">stove_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.08 - 0.90 ) for ST - segment depression . We found similar associations with the before - and - after comparison . The intervention was not significantly associated with HRV . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">The_1</font> <font color="red">stove_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> was associated with reduced occurrence of nonspecific ST - segment depression , suggesting that household wood smoke exposures affect ventricular repolarization and potentially cardiovascular health .
