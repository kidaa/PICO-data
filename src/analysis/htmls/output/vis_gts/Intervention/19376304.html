Two doses of <font color="red">dabigatran_2</font> ( 110 and 150 mg BID ) are being evaluated . RE - LY is a phase 3 , prospective , randomized , open - label multinational ( 44 countries ) trial of patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 risk factor for stroke . Recruitment concluded with a total of 18,113 patients . Patients who were VKA - naive and experienced are included in balanced proportions . The primary outcome is stroke ( including hemorrhagic ) or systemic embolism . Safety outcomes are bleeding , liver function abnormalities , and other adverse events . Adjudication of end points is blinded to drug assignment . The trial is expected to accrue a minimum of 450 events with a minimum 1-year of follow - up . RE - LY is the largest AF stroke prevention trial yet undertaken . It is unique because it includes equal numbers of VKA - experienced and naive patients and evaluates 2 different dosages of <font color="red">dabigatran_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> which may allow tailoring of dosing to individual patient needs . The worldwide site distribution and broad range of stroke risk further increase the general applicability of the trial . Results are expected in 2009 .
