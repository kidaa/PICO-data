<br>
<br> The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ( HOPE ) study was important because it showed the benefits of <font color="red">ramipril_4</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">an_1</font> <font color="red">angiotensin_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">converting_1</font> <font color="red">enzyme_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ACE_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">inhibitor_1</font> - in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events . Treatment with <font color="red">ramipril_3</font> significantly reduced the rates of death , myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary revascularization , cardiac arrest and heart failure , as well as the risk of diabetes - related complications and of diabetes itself . The effects of <font color="red">therapy_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">vitamin_2</font> <font color="red">E_2</font> were also evaluated , but no statistical benefits were shown . The benefits of <font color="red">ACE_1</font> <font color="red">inhibitor_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> that were observed were likely due to a variety of mechanisms , not just a reduction in blood pressure .
