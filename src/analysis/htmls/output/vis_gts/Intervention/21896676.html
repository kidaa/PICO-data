A <font color="red">physiotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">service_2</font> to an emergency extended care unit does not decrease admission rates to hospital : a randomised trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND One of the reasons <font color="red">physiotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">services_1</font> are provided to emergency departments ( EDs ) and emergency extended care units ( EECUs ) is to review patients ' mobility to ensure they are safe to be discharged home . 
<br> AIM To investigate whether a <font color="red">physiotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">service_2</font> to an EECU altered the rate of hospital admission , rate of re - presentation to the ED , visits to community healthcare practitioners , return to usual work / home / leisure activities and patient satisfaction . 
<br> METHODS A randomised trial with concealed allocation , assessor blinding and intention - to - treat analysis was undertaken in an EECU . The sample comprised 186 patients ( mean age 70 years , 123 ( 66% ) female patients , 130 ( 70% ) trauma ) who were referred for <font color="red">physiotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">assessment_2</font> <font color="red">/_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Referral occurred at any stage of the patients ' EECU admission . All participants received <font color="red">medical_2</font> <font color="red">/_2</font> <font color="red">nursing_2</font> <font color="red">care_2</font> as required . The <font color="red">physiotherapy_1</font> group also received <font color="red">physiotherapy_4</font> <font color="red">assessment_3</font> <font color="red">/_3</font> <font color="red">intervention_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font> 
<br> RESULTS The <font color="red">physiotherapy_1</font> group had a 4% ( 95% CI -18% to 9% ) lower rate of admission to hospital than the control group and a 4% ( 95% CI -6% to 13% ) higher rate of re - presentation to the ED , which were statistically non - significant ( pâ‰¥0.45 ) . Differences between groups for use of community healthcare resources , return to usual work / home / leisure activities and satisfaction with their EECU care were small and not significant . 
<br> CONCLUSION A <font color="red">physiotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">service_2</font> for EECU patients , as provided in this study , did not reduce the rate of hospital admission , rate of re - presentation to the ED , use of community healthcare resources , or improve the rate of return to usual work / home / leisure activities or patient satisfaction .
