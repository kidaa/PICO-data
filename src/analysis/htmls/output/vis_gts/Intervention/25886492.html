A randomised controlled trial of personalised decision support delivered via the internet for bowel cancer screening with a faecal occult blood test : the effects of tailoring of messages according to social cognitive variables on participation . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND In Australia , bowel cancer screening participation using faecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) is low . Decision support tailored to psychological predictors of participation may increase screening . The study compared <font color="red">tailored_2</font> <font color="red">computerised_2</font> <font color="red">decision_2</font> <font color="red">support_2</font> to <font color="red">non_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">tailored_2</font> <font color="red">computer_2</font> <font color="red">or_2</font> <font color="red">paper_2</font> <font color="red">information_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The primary outcome was FOBT return within 12   weeks . Additional analyses were conducted on movement in decision to screen and change on psychological variables . 
<br> METHODS A parallel , randomised controlled , trial invited 25,511 people aged 50 - 74 years to complete an eligibility questionnaire . Eligible respondents ( n   =   3,408 ) were assigned to <font color="red">Tailored_2</font> <font color="red">Personalised_2</font> <font color="red">Decision_2</font> <font color="red">Support_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">TPDS_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">Non_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">Tailored_2</font> <font color="red">PDS_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">NTPDS_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> or <font color="red">Control_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CG_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> ( intention - to - treat , ITT sample ) . <font color="red">TPDS_2</font> and <font color="red">NTPDS_2</font> groups completed an on - line baseline survey ( BS ) and accessed generic information . The <font color="red">TPDS_2</font> group additionally received a tailored intervention . <font color="red">CG_1</font> participants completed a paper BS only . Those completing the BS ( n   =   2270 ) were mailed an FOBT and requested to complete an endpoint survey ( ES ) that re - measured BS variables ( per - protocol , PP sample ) . 
<br> RESULTS FOBT return : In the ITT sample , there was no significant difference between any group ( χ ( 2)(2 )   =   2.57 , p   =   .26 ; <font color="red">TPDS_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 32.5% ; <font color="red">NTPDS_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 33% ; and <font color="red">CG_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 34.5% ) . In the PP sample , FOBT return in the internet groups was significantly higher than the paper group ( χ ( 2)(2 )   =   17.01 , p   <   .001 ; <font color="red">TPDS_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 80% ; <font color="red">NTPDS_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 83% ; and <font color="red">CG_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 74% ) . FOBT completion by <font color="red">TPDS_2</font> and <font color="red">NTPDS_2</font> did not differ ( χ ( 2)(1 )   =   2.23 , p   =   .13 ) . Age was positively associated with kit return . Decision to screen : 2227/2270 of the PP sample provided complete BS data . Participants not wanting to screen at baseline ( 1083/2227 ) and allocated to <font color="red">TPDS_1</font> and <font color="red">NTPDS_1</font> were significantly more likely to decide to screen and return an FOBT than those assigned to the <font color="red">CG_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> FOBT return by <font color="red">TPDS_2</font> and <font color="red">NTPDS_2</font> did not differ from one another ( OR   =   1.16 , p   =   .42 ) . Change on psychosocial predictors : Analysis of change indicated that salience and coherence of screening and self - efficacy were improved and faecal aversion decreased by tailored messaging . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Online information resources may have a role in encouraging internet - enabled people who are uncommitted to screening to change their attitudes , perceptions and behaviour .
