<br> The effects of the <font color="red">high_1</font> <font color="red">intake_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">Maillard_1</font> <font color="red">reaction_1</font> <font color="red">products_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">MRP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> on calcium availability in adolescents and across Caco-2 cell monolayers were examined . In a 2 week randomized two - period crossover trial , 18 male adolescents consumed two diets , named <font color="red">white_1</font> <font color="red">diet_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">WD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and <font color="red">brown_1</font> <font color="red">diet_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">BD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> which were poor and rich in MRP , respectively . A 3 day balance was performed at the end of each period , and fasting blood samples were collected . Calcium solubility and absorption across Caco-2 cells were studied after the in vitro digestion of the diets . The in vitro assay showed similar solubility after the in vitro digestion and similar transport across Caco-2 cells . In accordance , calcium bioavailability in adolescents did not vary between the diets ( % WD = 40.4 + /- 5.1 , % BD = 38.2 + /- 3.6 ) . Serum and urine biochemical parameters related to calcium status and bone metabolism remained unaltered . Only deoxypyridinoline values were significantly lower after consumption of the <font color="red">BD_1</font> ( 13.0 + /- 1.1 compared to 18.3 + /- 2.1 nM / Mm Cr in the <font color="red">WD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> , possibly indicative of less efficient bone turnover during this period . As calcium acquired during adolescence is essential to maximize peak bone mass and to prevent osteoporosis , possible long - term effects of excessive MRP intake during this period warrant attention .
