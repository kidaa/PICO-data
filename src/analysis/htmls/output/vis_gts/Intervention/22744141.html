<br> PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of <font color="red">enhanced_3</font> <font color="red">milieu_3</font> <font color="red">teaching_3</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">EMT_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> implemented by parents and therapists versus therapists only on the language skills of preschool children with intellectual disabilities ( IDs ) , including children with Down syndrome and children with autism spectrum disorders . 
<br> METHOD Seventy - seven children were randomly assigned to <font color="red">2_1</font> <font color="red">treatments_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">parent_3</font> <font color="red">+_3</font> <font color="red">therapist_3</font> <font color="red">EMT_3</font> <font color="red">or_2</font> <font color="red">therapist_3</font> <font color="red">-_3</font> <font color="red">only_3</font> <font color="red">EMT_3</font> <font color="red">)_3</font> and received 36 intervention sessions . Children were assessed before , immediately after , 6 months after , and 12 months after intervention . Separate linear regressions were conducted for each standardized and observational measure at each time point . 
<br> RESULTS Parents in the parent + therapist group demonstrated greater use of <font color="red">EMT_2</font> <font color="red">strategies_1</font> at home than untrained parents in the therapist - only group , and these effects maintained over time . Effect sizes for observational measures ranged from d = 0.10 to d = 1.32 favoring the parent + therapist group , with the largest effect sizes found 12 months after intervention . 
<br> CONCLUSION Findings from this study indicate generally that there are benefits to training parents to implement <font color="red">naturalistic_1</font> <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> <font color="red">strategies_1</font> with preschool children who have ID and significant language impairments .
