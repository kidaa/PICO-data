<br> PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of <font color="red">enhanced_2</font> <font color="red">milieu_2</font> <font color="red">teaching_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">EMT_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">implemented_2</font> <font color="red">by_2</font> <font color="red">parents_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">therapists_2</font> versus <font color="red">therapists_1</font> <font color="red">only_1</font> on the language skills of preschool children with intellectual disabilities ( IDs ) , including children with Down syndrome and children with autism spectrum disorders . 
<br> METHOD Seventy - seven children were randomly assigned to 2 treatments ( <font color="red">parent_1</font> <font color="red">+_1</font> <font color="red">therapist_1</font> <font color="red">EMT_1</font> or <font color="red">therapist_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">only_1</font> <font color="red">EMT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and received 36 intervention sessions . Children were assessed before , immediately after , 6 months after , and 12 months after intervention . Separate linear regressions were conducted for each standardized and observational measure at each time point . 
<br> RESULTS Parents in the <font color="red">parent_1</font> <font color="red">+_1</font> <font color="red">therapist_1</font> group demonstrated greater use of <font color="red">EMT_1</font> strategies at home than untrained parents in the <font color="red">therapist_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">only_1</font> group , and these effects maintained over time . Effect sizes for observational measures ranged from d = 0.10 to d = 1.32 favoring the <font color="red">parent_1</font> <font color="red">+_1</font> <font color="red">therapist_1</font> group , with the largest effect sizes found 12 months after intervention . 
<br> CONCLUSION Findings from this study indicate generally that there are benefits to training parents to implement naturalistic language intervention strategies with preschool children who have ID and significant language impairments .
