<br> Children acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things , but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired . In this article , it is proposed that children acquire generic knowledge by sharing in pretend play . In Experiment 1 , twenty - two 3- to 4-year - olds <font color="red">watched_1</font> <font color="red">pretense_1</font> in which a <font color="red">puppet_1</font> <font color="red">represented_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">"_1</font> <font color="red">nerp_1</font> <font color="red">"_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">an_1</font> <font color="red">unfamiliar_1</font> <font color="red">kind_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">animal_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> For instance , in one scenario , the nerp ate and disliked a carrot . When subsequently asked generic questions about real nerps , children 's responses suggested that they had learned general facts ( e.g. , nerps dislike carrots ) . In Experiment 2 , thirty - two 4- to 5-year - olds learned from <font color="red">scenarios_2</font> <font color="red">lacking_2</font> <font color="red">pretend_2</font> <font color="red">speech_2</font> <font color="red">or_2</font> <font color="red">sound_2</font> <font color="red">effects_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The findings reveal a long overlooked means by which children can acquire generic knowledge .
