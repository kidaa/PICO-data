Effects of <font color="red">mild_2</font> <font color="red">physical_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> on serum lipoproteins and metabolites of arachidonic acid : a controlled randomised trial in middle aged men . 
<br>
<br> To study the effects of <font color="red">physical_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> on biochemical risk factors for ischaemic heart disease 31 healthy middle aged men undertook <font color="red">regular_1</font> <font color="red">physical_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> for two months and 29 served as <font color="red">controls_1</font> in a randomised trial . In the men taking <font color="red">regular_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> serum cholesterol concentrations increased 26% more in the high density lipoprotein subfraction two ( HDL2 ) and decreased 31% more in the subfraction three ( HDL3 ) and 9% more in the low density lipoprotein fraction than in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group . A tendency towards increased plasma 6-keto - prostaglandin F1 alpha concentration and decreased serum thromboxane B2 concentration was found during the period of <font color="red">regular_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> but prostaglandin E2 concentrations remained unchanged . The increase in plasma 6-keto - prostaglandin F1 alpha concentration was associated with an increase in serum HDL2 cholesterol concentration in the group taking <font color="red">regular_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Our data suggest that <font color="red">mild_2</font> <font color="red">regular_2</font> <font color="red">physical_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> favourably influences cholesterol distribution in serum lipoproteins in healthy middle aged men and may have beneficial effects on circulating metabolites of arachidonic acid .
