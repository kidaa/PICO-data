Economic burden of childhood autism spectrum disorders . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To estimate the associations between autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) diagnoses and service use , caregiver time , and cost outcomes . 
<br> METHODS We used <font color="red">national_1</font> <font color="red">data_1</font> <font color="red">from_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">Medical_2</font> <font color="red">Expenditure_2</font> <font color="red">Panel_2</font> <font color="red">Survey_2</font> <font color="red">linked_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">National_1</font> <font color="red">Health_1</font> <font color="red">Interview_1</font> <font color="red">Survey_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">specific_1</font> <font color="red">survey_1</font> to estimate the annual utilization and costs for health care , school , ASD - related therapy , family - coordinated services , as well as caregiver time in children aged 3 to 17 years , with and without parent - reported ASD . <font color="red">Regression_1</font> <font color="red">analyses_1</font> estimated the association between ASD diagnosis and cost , controlling for child gender , age , race / ethnicity , insurance status , household income , country region and urban / rural classification , and non - ASD - related illnesses . 
<br> RESULTS Children with parent - reported ASD had higher levels of health care office visits and prescription drug use compared with children without ASD ( P < .05 ) . A greater proportion of children in the ASD group used special educational services ( 76% vs. 7% in the control group , P < .05 ) . After adjusting for child demographic characteristics and non - ASD - associated illnesses , ASD was associated with $ 3020 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] : $ 1017-$4259 ) higher health care costs and $ 14,061 ( 95% CI : $ 4390-$24,302 ) higher aggregate non - health care costs , including $ 8610 ( 95% CI : $ 6595-$10,421 ) higher school costs . In adjusted analyses , parents who reported that their child had ASD did not have significantly higher out - of - pocket costs or spend more time on caregiving activities compared with control parents . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The economic burden associated with ASD is substantial and can be measured across multiple sectors of our society . Previous analyses that focused on health care underestimated this economic burden , particularly for school systems .
