A double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> controlled study of <font color="red">fluvoxamine_1</font> in adults with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction , impairments in communication , and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests . Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism . No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism . 
<br> METHODS Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">controlled_1</font> trial of the <font color="red">potent_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">selective_1</font> <font color="red">serotonin_2</font> <font color="red">uptake_2</font> <font color="red">inhibitor_2</font> <font color="red">fluvoxamine_4</font> <font color="red">maleate_4</font> <font color="red">._4</font> <font color="red">Behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">ratings_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">obtained_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">baseline_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">after_1</font> <font color="red">4_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">8_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">12_1</font> <font color="red">weeks_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS Eight ( 53% ) of 15 patients in the <font color="red">fluvoxamine_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the <font color="red">placebo_1</font> group ( P = .001 ) . <font color="red">Fluvoxamine_1</font> was superior to <font color="red">placebo_1</font> in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior ( P < .001 ) , maladaptive behavior ( P < .001 ) , and aggression ( P < .03 ) , and in improving some aspects of social relatedness ( P < .04 ) , especially language usage ( P < .008 ) . Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior , or full - scale IQ . Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients , fluvoxamine was well tolerated . No dyskinesias , adverse cardiovascular events , or seizures occurred . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">Fluvoxamine_1</font> is more effective than <font color="red">placebo_1</font> in the short - term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults . Controlled studies of <font color="red">fluvoxamine_1</font> and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism .
