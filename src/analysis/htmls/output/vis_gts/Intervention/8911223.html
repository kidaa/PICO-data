A double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> controlled study of <font color="red">fluvoxamine_2</font> in adults with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction , impairments in communication , and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests . Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism . No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism . 
<br> METHODS Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> controlled trial of the potent and <font color="red">selective_1</font> <font color="red">serotonin_1</font> <font color="red">uptake_1</font> <font color="red">inhibitor_1</font> <font color="red">fluvoxamine_2</font> <font color="red">maleate_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks of treatment . 
<br> RESULTS Eight ( 53% ) of 15 patients in the <font color="red">fluvoxamine_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the <font color="red">placebo_2</font> group ( P = .001 ) . <font color="red">Fluvoxamine_2</font> was superior to <font color="red">placebo_2</font> in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior ( P < .001 ) , maladaptive behavior ( P < .001 ) , and aggression ( P < .03 ) , and in improving some aspects of social relatedness ( P < .04 ) , especially language usage ( P < .008 ) . Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior , or full - scale IQ . Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients , <font color="red">fluvoxamine_2</font> was well tolerated . No dyskinesias , adverse cardiovascular events , or seizures occurred . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">Fluvoxamine_2</font> is more effective than <font color="red">placebo_2</font> in the short - term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults . Controlled studies of <font color="red">fluvoxamine_2</font> and other potent and <font color="red">selective_1</font> <font color="red">serotonin_1</font> <font color="red">uptake_1</font> <font color="red">inhibitors_1</font> seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism .
