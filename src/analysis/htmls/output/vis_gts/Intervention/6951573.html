A controlled study of psychiatric hospital versus community treatment - the effect on relatives . 
<br>
<br> One hundred and twenty patients presenting at Macquarie Hospital for admission were randomly allocated into two groups . The control group patients received <font color="red">standard_2</font> <font color="red">hospital_2</font> <font color="red">care_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">follow_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">up_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The project group patients were not admitted if this could be avoided ; instead they were taken back to the community by the project team who provided them and their relatives with <font color="red">comprehensive_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">assertive_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">prolonged_2</font> <font color="red">follow_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">up_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_2</font> <font color="red">backed_2</font> <font color="red">by_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">24-hour_2</font> <font color="red">crisis_2</font> <font color="red">service_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The majority ( 63% ) of the project group had no admission during the 10 month study period . Initially , the burden on the relatives of the project group was higher , but by one month it was somewhat lower and by four months it was significantly lower than the burden on the control group relatives . Relatives of the project group patients were significantly more satisfied with the treatment than control group relatives . It is clearly feasible to treat most psychiatric patients in the community without increasing the burden on their relatives .
