Data mining the ScanBrit study of a <font color="red">gluten-_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">casein_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">free_2</font> <font color="red">dietary_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> for children with autism spectrum disorders : behavioural and psychometric measures of dietary response . 
<br>
<br> We previously reported results based on the examination of a <font color="red">gluten-_4</font> <font color="red">and_4</font> <font color="red">casein_4</font> <font color="red">-_4</font> <font color="red">free_4</font> <font color="red">diet_4</font> as an intervention for children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as part of the ScanBrit collaboration . Analysis based on grouped results indicated several significant differences between dietary and non - dietary participants across various core and peripheral areas of functioning . Results also indicated some disparity in individual responses to dietary modification potentially indicative of responder and non - responder differences . Further examination of the behavioural and psychometric data garnered from participants was undertaken , with a view to determining potential factors pertinent to response to <font color="red">dietary_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Participants with clinically significant scores indicative of inattention and hyperactivity behaviours and who had a significant positive changes to said scores were defined as responders to the <font color="red">dietary_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Analyses indicated several factors to be potentially pertinent to a positive response to <font color="red">dietary_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> in terms of symptom presentation . Chronological age was found to be the strongest predictor of response , where those participants aged between 7 and 9 years seemed to derive most benefit from <font color="red">dietary_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Further analysis based on the criteria for original study inclusion on the presence of the urine compound , trans - indolyl-3-acryloylglycine may also merit further investigation . These preliminary observations on potential best responder characteristics to a <font color="red">gluten-_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">casein_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">free_2</font> <font color="red">diet_2</font> for children with autism require independent replication .
