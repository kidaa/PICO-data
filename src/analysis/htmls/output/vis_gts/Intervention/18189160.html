Feasibility of two <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">dense_1</font> <font color="red">FEC_1</font> <font color="red">regimens_1</font> with growth factor support for adjuvant therapy in patients with early breast cancer : results from a randomised study of the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group ( CECOG ) . 
<br>
<br> Addition of <font color="red">epirubicin_1</font> to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer , but the optimal dose remains unclear . Further improvements can be achieved with dose - dense regimens , but densification of <font color="red">fluorouracil_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">epirubicin_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">cyclophosphamide_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">FEC_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> has proved difficult , with FEC(60 ) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100 ) associated with toxicity . We investigated the feasibility of two <font color="red">intermediate_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">dense_1</font> <font color="red">FEC_2</font> <font color="red">regimens_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Patients were randomised to six cycles of <font color="red">FEC(75_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> or <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle . Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle . The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or = 85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the <font color="red">FEC(75_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> arms , respectively . Of 147 <font color="red">FEC(75_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> infusions , 4.1% were delayed , while 9.8% of 143 <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> infusions were delayed . The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal / logistical reasons . One dose reduction occurred during the study ( <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> , related to diarrhoea . Grade 3 - 4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> arm . There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study . The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events ; no event resulted in discontinuation . Only one patient ( <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> experienced serious adverse events ( vomiting and throat oedema ) . In conclusion , dose - dense <font color="red">FEC(75_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> are feasible with pegfilgrastim support . These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3 - 4 toxicity .
