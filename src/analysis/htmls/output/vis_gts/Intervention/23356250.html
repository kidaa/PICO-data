Influence of <font color="red">lime_2</font> <font color="red">juice_2</font> on the severity of sickle cell anemia . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The pain in sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) is often triggered by dehydration , acidosis , and fever that are usually due to malaria . Intake of <font color="red">lime_2</font> <font color="red">juice_2</font> was recently demonstrated to facilitate clearance of the malaria parasite . It was therefore sought to determine whether <font color="red">regular_1</font> <font color="red">intake_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">lime_2</font> <font color="red">juice_2</font> will ameliorate crisis , especially recurrent bone pain . 
<br> DESIGN In this preliminary , open - labeled , randomized study , the effects of <font color="red">lime_2</font> <font color="red">juice_2</font> on the clinical and some laboratory characteristics of children with SCA were tested . 
<br> RESULTS Among the 113 children with SCA studied in two hospitals , the 58 receiving <font color="red">lime_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> had lower rates of significant painful episodes than the 55 <font color="red">without_1</font> <font color="red">lime_1</font> ( 37 versus 83 crises in 6 months , and 0.64±0.11 versus 1.51±0.34 average rates per child , p<0.001 ) . Also , fewer subjects than the <font color="red">controls_1</font> had significant painful episodes ( 50.0% versus 92.7% ) ; febrile illness ( 46.6% versus 87.3% ) and admission rate ( 3.4% versus 34.5% ) ( p<0.001 ) . The mean hematocrit of the subjects ( 26.23±2.03% ) at the end of the study was also higher , p<0.001 . However , transfusion rate , presence of hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , and jaundice was similar . Treatment with lime did not cause any significant side - effect . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Regular intake of <font color="red">lime_2</font> <font color="red">juice_2</font> may be of great therapeutic and nutritional relevance in children with SCA .
