<br>
<br> This study examined the implementation phase of a four - year research project to test the effectiveness of strategies to increase diffusion of Smart Choices , a school - based tobacco prevention program . The impact on curriculum implementation of two approaches to teacher training are compared . School districts were randomly assigned to a <font color="red">live_2</font> <font color="red">workshop_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> or <font color="red">video_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">condition_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The outcome of the evaluation was teachers ' implementation of Smart Choices . Results show a lower proportion of video - trained teachers implemented the curriculum , but overall completeness and fidelity of implementation for those teachers who did teach the curriculum were comparable for the two groups . Video - trained teachers , however , were less likely to use brainstorming and student presentations / role plays , two of the methods prescribed by the curriculum . Implications of the results for <font color="red">teacher_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> are discussed .
