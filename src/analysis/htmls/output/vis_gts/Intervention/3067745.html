<font color="red">Levobunolol_2</font> compared with <font color="red">timolol_2</font> <font color="red">:_2</font> a four - year study . 
<br>
<br> Fifty - one patients with raised intraocular pressure ( IOP ) were treated for up to four years with one of three ophthalmic solutions : <font color="red">0.5%_1</font> <font color="red">levobunolol_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">1%_1</font> <font color="red">levobunolol_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> or <font color="red">0.5%_1</font> <font color="red">timolol_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The study was conducted as a double - masked , randomised trial in which medications were administered twice daily to both eyes . <font color="red">Levobunolol_2</font> and <font color="red">timolol_2</font> were equally effective in reducing overall mean IOP ; reductions were greater than 8.8 mmHg in all three treatment groups . The study showed <font color="red">levobunolol_2</font> to be as safe and effective as <font color="red">timolol_2</font> in the long - term control of raised IOP .
