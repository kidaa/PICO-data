<br>

These preliminary findings suggest that <font color="red">VRH_2</font> <font color="red">analgesia_1</font> is a novel technology worthy of further study , both to improve pain management and to increase availability of <font color="red">hypnotic_1</font> <font color="red">analgesia_1</font> to populations without access to therapist - provided hypnosis and suggestion .
