A novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled - release <font color="red">chlorhexidine_1</font> delivery in chronic periodontitis : a randomized clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical , microbiologic , and serologic effects of <font color="red">chlorhexidine_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">CHX_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">chips_2</font> used as a subgingival controlled - release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing ( SRP ) . 
<br> METHODS Twenty - four patients presenting with ≥12 teeth with probing depth ( PD ) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups . After prophylaxis , <font color="red">CHX_1</font> <font color="red">chips_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">test_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">chips_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm . Ten days later , SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment . Immediately after SRP , new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm . Parameters were assessed at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after treatment . Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and at 1 month after treatment . Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Prevotella intermedia , Tannerella forsythia , and Treponema denticola were analyzed . Serum levels of high sensitive C - reactive and lipopolysaccharide - binding proteins were measured . The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann - Whitney U test ( P < 0.05 ) . 
<br> RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time . There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level ( CAL ) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups ( 1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group ) ( P < 0.05 ) . The treatment with <font color="red">CHX_2</font> <font color="red">chips_1</font> showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the " red complex " after 1 month ( P = 0.02 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION The use of <font color="red">CHX_2</font> <font color="red">chips_1</font> before and immediately after SRP improved CAL and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis .
