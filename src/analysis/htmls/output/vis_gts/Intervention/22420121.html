<font color="red">Training_1</font> <font color="red">referential_1</font> <font color="red">communicative_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> to individuals with autism spectrum disorder : a pilot study . 
<br>
<br> The present study reports the effects of <font color="red">referential_1</font> <font color="red">communication_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> in individuals formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Participants were 20 children with ASD ( M age = 14.3 yr . , SD = 4.2 ; 6 girls , 14 boys ) in the role of speakers and 20 control children , who acted as listeners . They were all enrolled in <font color="red">mainstream_1</font> <font color="red">compulsory_1</font> <font color="red">education_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Inclusion / exclusion criteria were defined according to the clinical diagnosis of ASD , the presence or absence of additional or associated disability , previous training in referential communication , and any drug treatment . Speakers were randomly assigned to one of two groups ( <font color="red">trained_1</font> vs <font color="red">untrained_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> . Linguistic age , cognitive level and autistic symptoms were analyzed , respectively , with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( PPVT ) , the Wechsler Intelligence Scale ( WISC - R or WAIS - III ) , and the Autistic Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) . Communicative abilities were analyzed through two indexes related to message complexity and self - regulation . The <font color="red">trained_1</font> group was trained in referential communication tasks ( task analysis , role taking , and task evaluation ) , while the <font color="red">untrained_1</font> group took part in a communicative game but without any specific communicative training . The results showed that the complexity of emitted messages had improved statistically significantly in the <font color="red">trained_1</font> group as an effect of <font color="red">training_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Ecological referential communication is shown to be an appropriate paradigm for studying the communicative process and its products and could be used to develop and implement a <font color="red">training_1</font> <font color="red">program_1</font> focused on those skills in which individuals with ASD are most deficient .
