<font color="red">Oral_2</font> <font color="red">contraceptive_2</font> <font color="red">use_2</font> is associated with increased cardiovascular reactivity in nonsmokers . 
<br>
<br> Women who smoke and take <font color="red">oral_2</font> <font color="red">contraceptives_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">OCs_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease , but the exact mechanismsfor the increased risk are not known . Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one mechanism for the enhanced risk , but the small number of studies examining whether <font color="red">OC_1</font> users who smoke have greater reactivity have produced mixed results . The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking , acute nicotine administration , and <font color="red">OC_1</font> <font color="red">use_1</font> on cardiovascular and lipid reactivity . Sixty healthy women , half of whom had been using <font color="red">OCs_1</font> for at least the previous 6 months , participated in the study . Approximately two thirds were smokers and were randomized to be tested after either a <font color="red">12-hr_5</font> <font color="red">nicotine_5</font> <font color="red">deprivation_5</font> <font color="red">or_4</font> <font color="red">administration_5</font> <font color="red">of_5</font> <font color="red">nicotine_5</font> <font color="red">gum_5</font> <font color="red">._5</font> One third were nonsmokers . Heart rate , blood pressure , and lipid measures were taken at rest , during a videotaped speech task , and during recovery from the task . Results indicated that , among <font color="red">OC_2</font> nonusers , there was no effect of smoking status or <font color="red">nicotine_2</font> <font color="red">administration_2</font> on cardiovascular reactivity . However , among <font color="red">OC_2</font> users , nonsmokers had significantly greater heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to stress . These data show that <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">nicotine_2</font> <font color="red">administration_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">form_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">nicotine_2</font> <font color="red">gum_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> has no effect on cardiovascular or lipid stress reactivity in women . However <font color="red">OC_2</font> <font color="red">use_1</font> among nonsmoking women is associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress .
