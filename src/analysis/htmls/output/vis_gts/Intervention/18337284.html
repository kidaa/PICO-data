Once - daily <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> versus twice - daily <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> in group A beta - haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta - haemolytic streptococcal ( GABHS ) pharyngitis . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To test the non - inferiority of once - daily ( QD ) oral <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> to the recommended twice - daily ( BID ) oral <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> in GABHS pharyngitis . 
<br> METHODS This was a randomised non - inferiority trial carried out in a school - based clinic in New Zealand . Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> 1500 mg QD ( or 750 mg if bodyweight was < or=30 kg ) or to oral <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> 500 mg BID ( or 250 mg if bodyweight was < or=20 kg ) for 10 days . Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence . 
<br> OUTCOME Eradication of GABHS , determined with follow - up throat cultures on days 3 - 6 , 12 - 16 and 26 - 36 . GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures ( and relapses ) from new acquisitions . Non - inferiority was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit ( CL ) for the difference in success of eradication in the <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> and <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> treatment groups of < or=10% . 
<br> RESULTS 353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> ( n = 177 ) or <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> ( n = 176 ) . The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the <font color="red">antibiotics_1</font> was 4.9% at days 3 - 6 , 6.5% at days 12 - 16 and 8.5% at days 26 - 36 . Treatment failures ( including relapses ) occurred at each visit in 5.8% , 12.7% and 10.7% of <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> recipients and 6.2% , 11.9% and 11.3% of <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> recipients , respectively . No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups . One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> CONCLUSION In this adequately powered study , once - daily oral <font color="red">amoxicillin_2</font> is not inferior to twice - daily <font color="red">penicillin_2</font> <font color="red">V_2</font> for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis .
