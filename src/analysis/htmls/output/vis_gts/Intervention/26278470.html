<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE Obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) with poor insight has severe consequences for patients ; nonetheless , no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for poor - insight OCD . A new psychotherapy for OCD , the <font color="red">inference_5</font> <font color="red">-_5</font> <font color="red">based_5</font> <font color="red">approach_5</font> <font color="red">(_4</font> <font color="red">IBA_4</font> <font color="red">)_4</font> <font color="red">,_3</font> <font color="red">targets_1</font> <font color="red">insight_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">OCD_1</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">strengthening_1</font> <font color="red">normal_1</font> <font color="red">sensory_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">driven_1</font> <font color="red">reality_1</font> <font color="red">testing_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of <font color="red">cognitive_4</font> <font color="red">behavior_4</font> <font color="red">therapy_4</font> <font color="red">(_3</font> <font color="red">CBT_3</font> <font color="red">)_3</font> for patients with OCD with poor insight . 
<br> METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted , in which 90 patients with OCD with poor insight received either 24 <font color="red">CBT_3</font> <font color="red">sessions_2</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> 24 <font color="red">IBA_2</font> <font color="red">sessions_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The primary outcome measure was the Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) . Secondary outcome measures were level of insight , anxiety and depressive symptoms , and quality of life . Mixed - effects models were used to determine the treatment effect . 
<br> RESULTS In both conditions , a significant OCD symptom reduction was reached , but no condition effects were established . Post hoc , in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight ( n = 23 ) , it was found that the patients treated with the <font color="red">IBA_1</font> reached a significantly higher OCD symptom reduction than the patients treated with <font color="red">CBT_2</font> [ estimated marginal mean = -7.77 , t(219.45 ) = -2.4 , p = 0.017 ] . 
<br> CONCLUSION Patients with OCD with poor insight improve significantly after psychological treatment . The results of this study suggest that both <font color="red">CBT_2</font> and the <font color="red">IBA_2</font> are effective treatments for OCD with poor insight . The <font color="red">IBA_2</font> might be more promising than <font color="red">CBT_2</font> for patients with more extreme poor insight .
