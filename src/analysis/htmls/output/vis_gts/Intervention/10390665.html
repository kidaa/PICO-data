Anti - emetic efficacy of prophylactic <font color="red">granisetron_2</font> compared with <font color="red">perphenazine_2</font> for the prevention of post - operative vomiting in children . 
<br>
<br> We have compared the efficacy of <font color="red">granisetron_2</font> with <font color="red">perphenazine_2</font> in the prevention of vomiting after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy in children . In a prospective , randomized , double - blind study , 90 paediatric patients , ASA I , aged 4 - 10 years , received <font color="red">granisetron_2</font> 40 mg kg-1 or <font color="red">perphenazine_2</font> 70 mg kg-1 ( n = 45 each ) intravenously immediately after an inhalation induction of anaesthesia . A standard general anaesthetic technique was employed throughout . A complete response , defined as no emesis with no need for another rescue <font color="red">antiemetic_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> during the first 3 h ( 0 - 3 h ) after anesthesia was 87% with <font color="red">granisetron_2</font> and 78% with <font color="red">perphenazine_2</font> ( P = 0.204 ) . The corresponding incidence during the next 21 h ( 3 - 24 h ) after anaesthesia was 87% and 62% ( P = 0.007 ) . No clinically serious adverse events were observed in any of the groups . We conclude that <font color="red">granisetron_2</font> is a better anti - emetic than <font color="red">perphenazine_2</font> for the long - term prevention of post - operative vomiting in children undergoing general anaesthesia for tonsillectomy .
