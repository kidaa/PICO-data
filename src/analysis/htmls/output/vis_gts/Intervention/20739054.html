<font color="red">Eltrombopag_2</font> for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( RAISE ) : a 6-month , randomised , phase 3 study . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Eltrombopag_2</font> is an oral <font color="red">thrombopoietin_1</font> <font color="red">receptor_1</font> <font color="red">agonist_1</font> for the treatment of thrombocytopenia . We aimed to compare the response to once daily <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> versus <font color="red">placebo_2</font> in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia during a 6-month period . 
<br> METHODS We undertook a phase 3 , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months ' duration who had baseline platelet counts lower than 30,000 per μL. Patients were randomly allocated ( in a 2:1 ratio ) treatment with <font color="red">local_1</font> <font color="red">standard_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">plus_1</font> <font color="red">50_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> or matching <font color="red">placebo_2</font> once daily for 6 months . Randomisation was done centrally with a computer - generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count ( ≤ 15,000 per μL ) , use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia , and splenectomy status . Patients , investigators , and those assessing data were masked to allocation . Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response . Patients were assessed for response to treatment ( defined as a platelet count of 50,000 - 400,000 per μL ) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter ; the primary endpoint was the odds of response to <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> versus <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00370331 . 
<br> FINDINGS Between Nov 22 , 2006 , and July 31 , 2007 , 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention - to - treat analysis ( 135 <font color="red">eltrombopag_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 62 <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> . 106 ( 79% ) patients in the <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> group responded to treatment at least once during the study , compared with 17 ( 28% ) patients in the <font color="red">placebo_2</font> group . The odds of responding were greater in patients in the <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> group compared with those in the <font color="red">placebo_2</font> group throughout the 6-month treatment period ( odds ratio 8·2 , 99% CI 3·59 - 18·73 ; p<0·0001 ) . 37 ( 59% ) patients receiving <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> reduced concomitant treatment versus ten ( 32% ) patients receiving <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( p=0·016 ) . 24 ( 18% ) patients receiving <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> needed rescue treatment compared with 25 ( 40% ) patients receiving <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( p=0·001 ) . Three ( 2% ) patients receiving <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> had thromboembolic events compared with none in patients on <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Nine ( 7% ) <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> treated patients and two ( 3% ) in the <font color="red">placebo_2</font> group had mild increases in alanine aminotransferase concentration , and five ( 4% ) <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> treated patients ( vs none allocated to <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> had increases in total bilirubin . Four ( 7% ) patients taking <font color="red">placebo_1</font> had serious bleeding events , compared with one ( < 1% ) patient treated with <font color="red">eltrombopag_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> INTERPRETATION <font color="red">Eltrombopag_2</font> is effective for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia , and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment . These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with <font color="red">eltrombopag_2</font> treatment .
