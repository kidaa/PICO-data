<br> OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of <font color="red">branch_2</font> <font color="red">chain_2</font> <font color="red">amino_2</font> <font color="red">acid_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">BCAA_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">enriched_2</font> <font color="red">formula_2</font> on nutritional status and postoperative fatigue for digestive surgery patients . 
<br> METHODS Forty patients who underwent digestive surgery were randomly received parenteral nutrition with either <font color="red">BCAA_1</font> <font color="red">enriched_1</font> ( study group , n=20 ) or <font color="red">routine_2</font> <font color="red">amino_2</font> <font color="red">acid_2</font> ( control group , n=20 ) for seven consecutive days . Nitrogen balance , serum total protein , albumin , prealbumin , transferrin , retinol binding protein and postoperative fatigue score were monitored during the postoperative period . 
<br> RESULTS The cumulative postoperative fatigue scores were lower in <font color="red">BCAA_1</font> group than that in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group at the 4th , 5th and 7th day after operation ( P < 0.05 ) . Patients achieved positive nitrogen balance 2 days earlier in the study group than that in the control group , but there was no significant difference in cumulative nitrogen balance between the two groups . There was no significant difference in elevation of serum total protein , albumin , prealbumin , transferrin at the 7th day after operation between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) , compared with those at the first day after operation . The serum level of retinol binding protein was higher in <font color="red">BCAA_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">enriched_1</font> group than that in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group ( P=0.004 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">TPN_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">BCAA_2</font> <font color="red">enriched_1</font> <font color="red">formula_1</font> can reduce postoperative fatigue score and improve the nutritional status for digestive surgery patients .
