Recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma : a randomized phase III study of <font color="red">pegylated_2</font> <font color="red">liposomal_2</font> <font color="red">doxorubicin_2</font> versus <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare the efficacy and safety of <font color="red">pegylated_2</font> <font color="red">liposomal_2</font> <font color="red">doxorubicin_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">PLD_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> and <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or did n't respond to first - line , platinum - based chemotherapy . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either <font color="red">PLD_2</font> 50 mg / m(2 ) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> 1.5 mg / m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks . Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated ( 239 <font color="red">PLD_2</font> and 235 <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> . They comprised the intent - to - treat population . The overall progression - free survival rates were similar between the two arms ( P = .095 ) . The overall response rates for <font color="red">PLD_2</font> and <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> were 19.7% and 17.0% , respectively ( P = .390 ) . Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for <font color="red">PLD_2</font> and 56.7 weeks for <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Data analyzed in platinum - sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from <font color="red">PLD_2</font> for progression - free survival ( P = .037 ) , with medians of 28.9 for <font color="red">PLD_1</font> versus 23.3 weeks for <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> For overall survival , <font color="red">PLD_2</font> was significantly superior to <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> ( P = .008 ) , with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks . The platinum - refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of <font color="red">topotecan_2</font> ( P = .455 ) . Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with <font color="red">topotecan_1</font> and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification , or growth factor or blood product utilization . 
<br> CONCLUSION The comparable efficacy , favorable safety profile , and convenient dosing support the role of <font color="red">PLD_2</font> as a valuable treatment option in this patient population .
