<font color="red">Cophenylcaine_2</font> <font color="red">spray_1</font> vs. <font color="red">placebo_2</font> in flexible nasendoscopy : a prospective double - blind randomised controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> Practices vary across the UK on the use of topical preparation prior to flexible fibreoptic nasendoscopy . In this double - blind study , we randomised 98 patients to receive <font color="red">cophenylcaine_2</font> or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">nasal_1</font> <font color="red">spray_1</font> before flexible nasendoscopy . A visual analogue scale ( 1 - 100 ) was used to record pain , unpleasantness of taste and overall discomfort experienced . Overall , the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups . There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups ; however , the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the <font color="red">cophenylcaine_1</font> group . In linear regression , factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste . We conclude that the routine use of <font color="red">cophenylcaine_2</font> for nasal preparation is not justified before flexible nasendoscopy .
