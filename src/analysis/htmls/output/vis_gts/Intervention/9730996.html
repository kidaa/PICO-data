Inhaled <font color="red">fluticasone_2</font> reduces sputum inflammatory indices in severe bronchiectasis . 
<br>
<br> Although <font color="red">corticosteroid_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis , very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis . We have therefore performed a double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">controlled_1</font> study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled <font color="red">fluticasone_3</font> in bronchiectasis . Twenty - four patients ( 12 female ; mean age 51 yr ) were randomized into receiving either <font color="red">inhaled_1</font> <font color="red">fluticasone_4</font> ( 500 microgram twice daily ) via the Accuhaler device ( n = 12 ) <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">placebo_4</font> <font color="red">._4</font> At each visit , spirometry , 24-h sputum volume , sputum leukocyte density , bacterial densities , and concentrations of <font color="red">interleukin_1</font> ( IL)-1beta , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , and <font color="red">leukotriene_1</font> B4 ( LTB4 ) were determined . There was a significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta , IL-8 , and LTB4 after <font color="red">fluticasone_1</font> treatment . The <font color="red">fluticasone_1</font> group had one and the <font color="red">placebo_1</font> group three episodes of exacerbation . There were no significant changes in spirometry ( p > 0.05 ) or any reported adverse reactions in either group . The results of this study show that high - dose fluticasone is effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices in bronchiectasis . Large - scale and long - term studies are indicated to evaluate the effects of inhaled steroid therapy on the inflammatory components in bronchiectasis .
