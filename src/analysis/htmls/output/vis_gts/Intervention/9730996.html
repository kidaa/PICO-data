Inhaled <font color="red">fluticasone_2</font> reduces sputum inflammatory indices in severe bronchiectasis . 
<br>
<br> Although <font color="red">corticosteroid_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis , very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis . We have therefore performed a double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> controlled study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled <font color="red">fluticasone_2</font> in bronchiectasis . Twenty - four patients ( 12 female ; mean age 51 yr ) were randomized into receiving either inhaled <font color="red">fluticasone_2</font> ( 500 microgram twice daily ) via the Accuhaler device ( n = 12 ) or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> At each visit , spirometry , 24-h sputum volume , sputum leukocyte density , bacterial densities , and concentrations of interleukin ( IL)-1beta , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , and leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) were determined . There was a significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta , IL-8 , and LTB4 after <font color="red">fluticasone_1</font> treatment . The <font color="red">fluticasone_2</font> group had one and the <font color="red">placebo_1</font> group three episodes of exacerbation . There were no significant changes in spirometry ( p > 0.05 ) or any reported adverse reactions in either group . The results of this study show that high - dose <font color="red">fluticasone_2</font> is effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices in bronchiectasis . Large - scale and long - term studies are indicated to evaluate the effects of inhaled <font color="red">steroid_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> on the inflammatory components in bronchiectasis .
