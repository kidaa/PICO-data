Prediction of creatinine clearance from serum creatinine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis : comparison of six <font color="red">formulae_1</font> and one <font color="red">nomogram_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> The estimation of glomerular filtration rate is important for the medical treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . However , the determination of endogenous creatinine clearance ( Clcr ) from a 24-h urine collection is an unreliable and time - consuming procedure . We therefore tested the accuracy of six <font color="red">equations_1</font> and one <font color="red">nomogram_1</font> for the prediction of Clcr from serum creatinine ( Scr ) in 38 patients with RA and 20 controls . A positive correlation was found for all methods in the controls ( r = 0.83 - 0.94 ) and RA patients ( r = 0.51 - 0.69 ) . The methods did not overestimate Clcr in RA . In the RA group the <font color="red">simple_1</font> <font color="red">formula_1</font> <font color="red">published_1</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">Cockcroft_1</font> [ Clcr = ( ( 140 - age ) x body weight)/(72 x Scr ) , x 0.85 for females ] showed the best correlation with the measured Clcr . In RA the <font color="red">Cockroft_1</font> <font color="red">formula_1</font> can reliably be used to predict Clcr from Scr .
