<br>
<br> BACKGROUND In the interest of preserving residual insulin secretory capacity present at the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , we compared the efficacy of starting <font color="red">insulin_2</font> <font color="red">pump_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> at diagnosis with <font color="red">standard_2</font> <font color="red">multiple_2</font> <font color="red">daily_2</font> <font color="red">insulin_2</font> <font color="red">injections_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">MDIs_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS We conducted a prospective , randomized , pilot trial comparing <font color="red">MDI_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> with <font color="red">continuous_1</font> <font color="red">subcutaneous_1</font> <font color="red">insulin_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">pump_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> in 24 patients , 8 - 18 years old , with newly diagnosed T1D. Subjects were evaluated at enrollment and 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1D. Preservation of insulin secretion , measured by mixed - meal - stimulated C - peptide secretion , was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment . Between - group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , continuous glucose sensor data , insulin utilization , anthropometric measures , and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points . 
<br> RESULTS Initiation of <font color="red">pump_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed - meal tolerance test - stimulated C - peptide values at all time points , although these differences were not statistically significant . Nonetheless , improved glycemic control was observed in <font color="red">insulin_1</font> <font color="red">pump_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">treated_1</font> subjects ( more time spent with normoglycemia , better mean HbA1c ) , and <font color="red">pump_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">treated_1</font> subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Initiation of <font color="red">insulin_2</font> <font color="red">pump_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> at diagnosis improved glycemic control , was well tolerated , and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment . This study also suggests that earlier use of <font color="red">pump_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> might help to preserve residual β-cell function , although a larger clinical trial would be required to confirm this .
