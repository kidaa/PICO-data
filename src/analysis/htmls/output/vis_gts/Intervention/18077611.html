A double - blind , randomized , controlled , multicenter safety and immunogenicity study of a refrigerator - stable formulation of <font color="red">Zostavax_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> The vaccine <font color="red">Zostavax_2</font> has been shown to prevent herpes zoster ( HZ ) and postherpetic neuralgia and is recommended for individuals > or = 60 years of age . This study compared the safety and the immunogenicity of a <font color="red">refrigerator_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">stable_1</font> <font color="red">formulation_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Zostavax_2</font> <font color="red">refrigerated_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> with those of the <font color="red">current_1</font> <font color="red">formulation_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Zostavax_2</font> <font color="red">frozen_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> in subjects > or = 50 years of age . Subjects with a negative history for HZ were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of either formulation . Enrollment was stratified 1:2 by age ( 50 to 59 years and > or = 60 years ) . Safety was evaluated for 28 days postvaccination . Varicella - zoster virus ( VZV ) antibody responses were measured by a glycoprotein enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( gpELISA ) . The primary endpoints were the VZV antibody geometric mean titer ( GMT ; day 28 ) , the VZV antibody geometric mean rise ( GMR ; days 1 to 28 ) , and the incidence of vaccine - related serious adverse experiences ( AEs ) over 28 days . The <font color="red">refrigerated_1</font> ( n = 182 ) and <font color="red">frozen_1</font> ( n = 185 ) formulations induced similar GMTs ( 727.4 and 834.4 gpELISA units / ml , respectively ) ; the estimated GMT ratio ( refrigerated formulation / frozen formulation ) was 0.87 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.71 to 1.07 ) . The GMRs were 2.6- and 2.9-fold , respectively . No vaccine - related serious AEs were reported in either group , and the safety profiles of the formulations were generally similar . The frequencies of injection - site AEs during follow - up were 35.6% and 46.4% in the refrigerated and the frozen formulation groups , respectively , and were generally mild . The frequencies of systemic AEs were similar in the two groups , and those of vaccine - related AEs were approximately 6% in both groups . The <font color="red">refrigerator_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">stable_2</font> <font color="red">formulation_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">Zostavax_2</font> has an acceptable safety profile and is as immunogenic as the <font color="red">frozen_1</font> <font color="red">formulation_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> thus , the vaccine may be used in clinical settings where freezer availability is limited .
