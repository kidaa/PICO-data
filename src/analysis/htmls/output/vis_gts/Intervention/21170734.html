Serum biochemical characteristics of Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) , in response to blood sampling after <font color="red">clove_2</font> <font color="red">powder_2</font> <font color="red">solution_2</font> exposure . 
<br>
<br> In order to investigate the effect of anesthesia on serum parameters , Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) were blood - sampled immediately <font color="red">without_2</font> <font color="red">anesthesia_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> or subjected to following <font color="red">anesthesia_1</font> procedure : 40 , 120 , and 240 s exposure to 3,000 , 700 , and 500 mg l⁻¹ <font color="red">clove_2</font> <font color="red">solution_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> respectively . Blood samples were collected after these periods , when fish were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia . Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control . Serum lactate levels were significantly high in 500 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control group . Lactate levels were not significantly differed between control , 3,000 , and 700 mg l⁻¹ groups . There were no significant differences in serum levels of cholesterol , total protein , lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , Na⁺ , Cl⁻ , K⁺ , and Ca²⁺. Results suggest that rapid <font color="red">anesthesia_1</font> with higher dose is better than slow <font color="red">anesthesia_1</font> with lower dose for blood sampling in Beluga .
