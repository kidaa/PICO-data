Adherence to lifestyle recommendations by patients with depression . 
<br>
<br> INTRODUCTION There is an increasing amount of evidence showing that physical activity and sun exposure are effective coadjuvant treatments for patients with mild to moderate depression . However , there is a lack of information regarding patient 's adherence to these recommendations in daily clinical practice . 
<br> METHODS We conducted a study including 15 depressive patients who had been under antidepressant treatment for at least one month . They wore a wrist - watch - like actimetry sensor to measure physical activity and sun exposure 24 hours a day . After one week of baseline assessment , patients were randomised into one of the two arms of the study .

<br> RESULTS One week after recommendations were delivered , only patients in the experimental group had increased time of sun exposure and physical activity ( 25.8% and 14.3% , respectively ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Depressive patients are able to follow prescribed lifestyle recommendations in the short - term .
