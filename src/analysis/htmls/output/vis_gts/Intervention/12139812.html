<br> OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effects of <font color="red">limbal_2</font> <font color="red">epithelial_2</font> <font color="red">autograft_2</font> <font color="red">transplantation_2</font> and <font color="red">pterygium_1</font> <font color="red">excision_1</font> in the treatment of pterygium . 
<br> METHODS A prospective randomized paired - eye trial was studied . There were 208 patients ( 229 eyes ) with initial pterygium , and they were allocated to two groups : <font color="red">excision_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">pterygium_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">limbal_2</font> <font color="red">epithelial_2</font> <font color="red">autograft_2</font> <font color="red">transplantation_2</font> <font color="red">surgery_2</font> ( A group , 106 cases and 124 eyes ) and <font color="red">simple_2</font> <font color="red">pterygium_2</font> <font color="red">excision_2</font> ( B group , 102 cases and 105 eyes ) . The criteria for recovery were corneal transparency with stable epithelial healing and no abnormal proliferation of pterygium - like tissue . The post - operative follow - up periods ranged from 18 approximately 28 ( 22.4 + /- 4.9 ) months . 
<br> RESULTS Some of the patients lost follow - up . In the eyes followed up , 5 of 11 2 eyes ( 4.5% ) in A group and 41 of 96 eyes ( 42.7% ) in B group were recurred , the difference being very significant ( P < 0.001 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION To provide a new stem cell source , <font color="red">limbal_2</font> <font color="red">epithelial_2</font> <font color="red">autograft_2</font> <font color="red">transplantation_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> for an injured limb us is a reasonable therapeutic method for the treatment of pterygium .
