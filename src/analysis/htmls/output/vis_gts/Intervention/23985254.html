[ Impact of CCND1 A870 G polymorphism on acute adverse events in postoperative rectal cancer patients treated with <font color="red">adjuvant_1</font> <font color="red">concurrent_1</font> <font color="red">chemoradiotherapy_1</font> <font color="red">]_1</font> . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) of CCND1 A870 G and acute adverse events ( AEs ) in postoperative rectal cancer patients who received <font color="red">capecitabine_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">based_1</font> <font color="red">postoperative_1</font> <font color="red">chemoradiotherapy_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CRT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS Four hundred patients with stage II and III rectal cancer received postoperative <font color="red">CRT_1</font> of <font color="red">capecitabine_1</font> with or without <font color="red">oxaliplatin_1</font> were accumulated and prostectively studied in this study . The patients were randomly divided into two groups . Two hundred and twenty - eight patients were treated with concurrent <font color="red">capecitabine_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">radiotherapy_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Cap_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">CRT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> , and 172 patients were treated with <font color="red">capecitabine_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">oxaliplatin_1</font> <font color="red">plus_1</font> <font color="red">radiotherapy_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Cap_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Oxa_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">CRT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , v. 3.0 ( CTCAE v3.0 ) . The genotype of CCND1 A870 G in the patients was detected by polymerase chain reaction - based restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR - RFLP ) analysis . The associations between the SNP and acute AEs were indicated by odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) , which were computed with logistic regression model . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 136 patients presented severe AEs . Among them the frequencies of the three genotypes GG , GA and AA were 16.9% , 50.7% and 32.4% , compared with 24.6% , 48.1% and 27.3% , respectively , among the patients without severe AEs . Diarrhea was the most common AE , and severe diarrhea occurred in 109 patients . The frequencies of the three genotypes GG , GA and AA were 15.6% , 47.7% and 36.7% among these patients , compared with 24.4% , 49.5% and 26.1% , respectively , among patients without severe diarrhea . Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a 1.66-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea in patients with AA genotype ( 95%CI 1.03 - 2.67 , P = 0.038 ) compared with the cases with GG or GA genotypes . Stratified analysis showed that in the <font color="red">Cap_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Oxa_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">CRT_1</font> group , patients with AA genotype showed a 2.34-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea ( 95%CI 1.16 - 4.76 , P = 0.018 ) compared with those with GG or GA genotypes , but in the <font color="red">Cap_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">CRT_1</font> group , the SNP was not associated with the risk of severe diarrhea . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The genetic polymorphism of CCND1 A870 G might be a potential biomarker for predicting acute AEs in postoperative stage II and III rectal cancer patients treated with <font color="red">adjuvant_1</font> <font color="red">concurrent_1</font> <font color="red">chemoradiotherapy_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">capecitabine_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">oxaliplatin_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
