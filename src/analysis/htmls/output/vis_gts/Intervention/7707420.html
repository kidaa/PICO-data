Effects of <font color="red">individualized_1</font> <font color="red">breast_1</font> <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> <font color="red">counseling_1</font> <font color="red">:_1</font> a randomized trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Studies have shown that a majority of women with a family history of breast cancer have exaggerated perceptions of their own risk of this disease and experience excessive anxiety . In response to the need to communicate more accurate risk information to these women , <font color="red">specialized_1</font> <font color="red">programs_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">breast_1</font> <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> <font color="red">counseling_1</font> have been initiated in medical centers across the United States . 
<br> PURPOSE Our purpose was 1 ) to evaluate the impact of a <font color="red">standardized_1</font> <font color="red">protocol_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">individualized_1</font> <font color="red">breast_1</font> <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> <font color="red">counseling_1</font> on comprehension of personal risk among first - degree relatives of index breast cancer patients and 2 ) to identify women most and least likely to benefit from such counseling . 
<br> METHODS This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing <font color="red">individualized_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">risk_2</font> <font color="red">counseling_2</font> to <font color="red">general_2</font> <font color="red">health_2</font> <font color="red">counseling_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> We studied 200 women aged 35 years and older who had a family history of breast cancer in a first - degree relative . Women with a personal history of cancer were excluded . Risk comprehension was assessed as the concordance between perceived " subjective " lifetime breast cancer risk and estimated " objective " lifetime risk . 
<br> RESULTS The results of logistic regression analysis showed that women who received <font color="red">risk_2</font> <font color="red">counseling_2</font> were significantly more likely to improve their risk comprehension , compared with women in the control condition ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.5 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.3 - 9.5 ; P = .01 ) . However , in both groups , about two thirds of women continued to overestimate their lifetime risks substantially following counseling . Examination of subjects by treatment interaction effects indicated that <font color="red">risk_2</font> <font color="red">counseling_2</font> did not produce improved comprehension among the large proportion of women who had high levels of anxious preoccupation with breast cancer at base line ( P = .02 ) . In addition , white women were less likely to benefit than African - American women ( OR = 0.34 ; 95% CI = 0.11 - 0.99 ; P = .05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Efforts to counsel women about their breast cancer risks are not likely to be effective unless their breast cancer anxieties are also addressed . 
<br> IMPLICATIONS Attention to the psychological aspects of breast cancer risk will be critical in the development of <font color="red">risk_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">counseling_2</font> <font color="red">programs_1</font> that incorporate testing for the recently cloned breast cancer susceptibility gene , BRCA1 ( and BRCA2 when that gene has also been cloned ) .
