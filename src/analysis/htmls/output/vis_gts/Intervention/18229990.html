<br> This study reports results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at <font color="red">joint_2</font> <font color="red">attention_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">JA_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> and <font color="red">symbolic_2</font> <font color="red">play_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">SP_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> in preschool children with autism , with prediction to language outcome 12 months later . Participants were 58 children ( 46 boys ) with autism between 3 and 4 years of age . Children were randomized to a <font color="red">JA_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> an <font color="red">SP_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> or <font color="red">control_1</font> group . Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5 - 6 weeks . Assessments of JA skills , SP skills , mother - child interactions , and language development were collected at 4 time points : pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers . Results indicate that expressive language gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group , and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated . For children beginning treatment with the lowest language levels , the <font color="red">JA_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> improved language outcome significantly more than did the <font color="red">SP_1</font> or <font color="red">control_1</font> interventions . These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating <font color="red">JA_1</font> and <font color="red">SP_1</font> skills in young children with autism .
