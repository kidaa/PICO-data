<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Children with high - functioning autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety . Anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school , home and community environments . <font color="red">Cognitive_1</font> <font color="red">behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">therapies_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CBT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms . Modified CBT interventions for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded promising results . 
<br> METHODS Fifty children with high - functioning ASD and anxiety were randomizedto <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">CBT_2</font> or <font color="red">treatment_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">as_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">usual_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">TAU_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> for 12 weeks . Independent clinical evaluators , blind to condition , completed structured interviews ( Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule â€“ Parent Version;ADIS - P ) pre- and post - intervention condition . 
<br> RESULTS Forty - seven children completed either the <font color="red">CBT_1</font> or <font color="red">TAU_1</font> condition . Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the <font color="red">CBT_1</font> group . Significant differences by group were noted in Clinician Severity Ratings , diagnostic status , and clinician ratings of global improvement . In the intent - to - treat sample , 10 of 20 children ( 50% ) in the <font color="red">CBT_1</font> group had a clinically meaningful positive treatment response , compared to 2 of 23 children ( 8.7% ) in the <font color="red">TAU_1</font> group . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Initial results from this randomized , designed treatment study suggest that <font color="red">agroup_1</font> <font color="red">CBT_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> <font color="red">specifically_1</font> <font color="red">developed_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">ASD_1</font> may be effective in decreasing anxiety . Limitations of this study include small sample size , lack of an attention control group , and use of outcome measures normed with typically developing children
