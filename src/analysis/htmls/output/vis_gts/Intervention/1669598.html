<br> To verify the efficacy and the tolerability of <font color="red">local_2</font> <font color="red">immunotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">LI_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">inhalation_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">powder_1</font> <font color="red">extract_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">house_1</font> <font color="red">dust_1</font> <font color="red">mite_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">HDM_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> in comparison with <font color="red">parenteral_2</font> <font color="red">immunotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">PI_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">injection_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 10 patients with asthma due to HDM were studied in a blind fashion . 5 patients ( Group A ) underwent <font color="red">LI_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">subcutaneous_1</font> <font color="red">injections_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> 5 patients ( Group B ) underwent <font color="red">PI_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">inhalation_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">lactose_1</font> for 6 months . In both groups each inhalation was preceded by premedication with disodium cromoglycate ( DSCG ) ( 40 mg ) . In Group A a significant decrease in symptoms score and in peak expiratory flow ( PEF)-derived parameters was observed already after 3 months of treatment , and 2 patients lost the late component of the bronchial response to the challenge with HDM . No significant variation was found in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water ( UNDW ) and in immunologic humoral and cellular parameters in peripheral blood after treatment in either group . No local important adverse reactions were observed in Group A and no systemic side effects were observed in either group . We conclude that <font color="red">LI_2</font> is as effective as <font color="red">PI_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> but more rapid in its action , in the treatment of asthma due to HDM . Moreover , <font color="red">LI_2</font> is locally well tolerated , providing DSCG is inhaled before each therapeutic inhalation , and does not induce systemic side effects .
