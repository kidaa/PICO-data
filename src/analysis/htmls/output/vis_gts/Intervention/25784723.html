<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Public - health guidelines recommend patients with congenital heart disease to <font color="red">exercise_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Studies have shown that patients with congenital heart disease can improve <font color="red">physical_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> capacity . The effect of <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">regional_1</font> <font color="red">ventricular_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> has hardly been studied . We performed a pilot study to assess whether an <font color="red">exercise_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">program_2</font> would result in adverse changes of regional ventricular performance in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot . 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS Multicenter prospective randomized controlled pilot study in patients with tetralogy of Fallot aged 10 to 25 years . A 12-week <font color="red">standardized_2</font> <font color="red">aerobic_2</font> <font color="red">dynamic_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">program_2</font> ( 3 one - hour sessions per week ) was used . Pre- and post - training <font color="red">cardiopulmonary_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> <font color="red">tests_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> MRI , and echocardiography , including tissue - Doppler imaging , were performed . Patients were randomized to the <font color="red">exercise_2</font> group ( n=28 ) or <font color="red">control_2</font> group ( n=20 ) . One patient in the <font color="red">exercise_1</font> group dropped out . Change in tissue - Doppler imaging parameters was similar in the <font color="red">exercise_2</font> group and <font color="red">control_2</font> group ( change in right ventricle free wall peak velocity E ' exercise group , 0.8±2.6 cm / s ; control group , 0.9±4.1 ; peak velocity A ' exercise group , 0.4±2.4 m / s ; control group 4.6±18.1 cm / s ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS This randomized controlled pilot study provides preliminary data suggesting that regional ventricular performance is well maintained during 3-month <font color="red">aerobic_2</font> <font color="red">dynamic_2</font> <font color="red">exercise_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> in children and young adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot . This information might help patients adhere to current public - health guidelines .
