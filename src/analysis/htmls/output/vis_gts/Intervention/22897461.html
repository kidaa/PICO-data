Effect of <font color="red">rosuvastatin_2</font> monotherapy or in combination with <font color="red">fenofibrate_2</font> or <font color="red">ω-3_2</font> <font color="red">fatty_2</font> <font color="red">acids_2</font> on lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Raised triglycerides ( TG ) , decreased high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) levels and a predominance of small dense low density lipoproteins ( sdLDL ) are characteristics of the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of <font color="red">high_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">rosuvastatin_2</font> <font color="red">monotherapy_1</font> with moderate dosing combined with <font color="red">fenofibrate_2</font> or <font color="red">ω-3_2</font> <font color="red">fatty_2</font> <font color="red">acids_2</font> on the lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and MetS. 
<br> METHODS We previously randomised patients with low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL - C ) > 160 and TG > 200   mg / dl to <font color="red">rosuvastatin_2</font> <font color="red">monotherapy_1</font> 40   mg / day ( <font color="red">R_1</font> group , n = 30 ) or <font color="red">rosuvastatin_2</font> <font color="red">10_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">day_1</font> <font color="red">combined_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">fenofibrate_2</font> 200 mg / day ( <font color="red">RF_1</font> group , n = 30 ) or <font color="red">ω-3_2</font> <font color="red">fatty_2</font> <font color="red">acids_2</font> 2 g / day ( <font color="red">Rω_1</font> group , n = 30 ) . In the present study , only patients with MetS were included ( 24 , 23 and 24 in the <font color="red">R_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">RF_1</font> and <font color="red">Rω_1</font> groups respectively ) . At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment , the lipoprotein subfraction profile was determined by polyacrylamide 3% gel electrophoresis . 
<br> RESULTS The mean LDL size was significantly increased in all groups . This change was more prominent with <font color="red">RF_1</font> than with other treatments in parallel with its greater hypotriglyceridemic capacity ( p < 0.05 compared with <font color="red">R_1</font> and <font color="red">Rω_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> . A decrease in insulin resistance by <font color="red">RF_1</font> was also noted . Only <font color="red">RF_1</font> significantly raised HDL - C levels ( by 7.7% , p < 0.05 ) by increasing the cholesterol of small HDL particles . The cholesterol of larger HDL subclasses was significantly increased by <font color="red">R_1</font> and <font color="red">Rω._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS All regimens increased mean LDL size ; <font color="red">RF_1</font> was the most effective . A differential effect of treatments was noted on the HDL subfraction profile .
