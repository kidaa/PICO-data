Social skills improvement in children with high - functioning autism : a pilot randomized controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> High - functioning autism ( HFA ) is characterized by persistent impairment in social interaction despite the absence of mental retardation . Although an increasing number of group - based programs for the improvement of social skills have been described , randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy .

Eligible patients were children and adolescents with HFA . Participants were randomized to the SST or LA group . The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling ( DANVA2 ) from baseline . After the 6-month training period , the SST Group made fewer errors in labeling anger on adult faces , whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable . Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces . QoL increased in the SST Group in the dimension of school environment , as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community . The <font color="red">SST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">GP_1</font> had higher efficacy than the <font color="red">LA_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">GP_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Data justify replication using larger samples .
