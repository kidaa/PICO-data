Role of <font color="red">angiotensin_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">converting_2</font> <font color="red">enzyme_2</font> <font color="red">inhibitors_2</font> in early antihypertensive treatment in non - insulin dependent diabetes mellitus . 
<br>
<br> The effect of <font color="red">captopril_1</font> <font color="red">monotherapy_1</font> on blood pressure and metabolism was investigated in a <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> controlled study in 30 non - insulin dependent ( Type II ) diabetic subjects during a 3-week observation period ( run - in / drug ; placebo / wash - out ) on a metabolic ward . <font color="red">Captopril_4</font> significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( 154/90 + /- 5/2 vs. 144/86 + /- 4/3 mmHg ) without major side effects . Mean run - in postprandial blood glucose concentrations were also reduced upon ACE - inhibition ( 9 a.m. : 12.7 + /- 0.4 vs. 11.1 + /- 0.4 mmol / l ; 1 p.m. : 11.0 + /- 0.3 vs. 8.9 + /- 0.3 mmol / l ; P less than 0.05 ) , while blood kinin concentrations ( 40.0 + /- 2.5 pmol / l ) were approximately doubled ( 108.8 + /- 23.5 pmol / l ; P less than 0.05 ) . Body mass index , fasting plasma insulin , serum electrolyte pattern , uric acid , white blood count , lipid profile as well as hepatic and renal function parameters remained unaltered throughout the observation period . The data are in line with recent experimental studies showing a beneficial metabolic effect of <font color="red">captopril_1</font> in Type II diabetes . <font color="red">ACE_1</font> <font color="red">inhibitors_1</font> might therefore become first - line drugs in early antihypertensive intervention in Type II diabetic patients .
