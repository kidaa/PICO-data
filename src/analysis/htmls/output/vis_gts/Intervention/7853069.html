Necessary but not sufficient : the effect of <font color="red">screening_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">feedback_1</font> on outcomes of primary care patients with untreated anxiety . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To consider the impact on primary care patient outcomes of using both a <font color="red">screener_1</font> to determine elevated anxiety levels among patients with previously undetected anxiety and a <font color="red">physician_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> to inform physicians of their patients ' conditions . 
<br> DESIGN Participating physicians were randomized to either the <font color="red">demonstration_2</font> or the <font color="red">control_2</font> <font color="red">arm_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and patients were assigned to a study arm based on the randomization of their physicians . The patients were followed for change in outcome measures during the five - month study period . 
<br> SETTING A mixed - model health maintenance organization serving approximately 110,000 enrollees in central Colorado . 
<br> PATIENTS / PARTICIPANTS 573 patients who had unrecognized and untreated anxiety identified from the approximately 8,000 patients who completed the waiting room screening questionnaire . 
<br> INTERVENTIONS A <font color="red">physician_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> served the dual function of 1 ) providing an <font color="red">educational_1</font> <font color="red">demonstration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> in the primary care setting and 2 ) <font color="red">providing_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">reporting_1</font> <font color="red">system_1</font> for summarizing the anxiety symptom levels and functioning status of the patients enrolled in the study . 
<br> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient outcomes were measured as changes in global anxiety scores , functioning and well - being , and patients ' reports of global improvements . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that this method of reporting symptoms and functioning status to primary care physicians did not significantly change patient outcomes . Improvement in outcomes appeared to be more closely associated with the patient 's severity of psychological distress .
