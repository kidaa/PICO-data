Ascaris and growth rates : a randomized trial of treatment . 
<br>
<br> Three hundred forty - one Tanzanian preschool children were randomly assigned to <font color="red">levamisole_3</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">placebo_3</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> given at three - month intervals . Weights and heights were measured at the tri - monthly treatment visits for a period of one year . Among the 273 children who were seen and weighed at the one - year follow - up visit , the rate of weight gain was 8 per cent greater for those receiving <font color="red">levamisole_3</font> <font color="red">than_2</font> <font color="red">for_2</font> <font color="red">placebo_3</font> <font color="red">-_3</font> <font color="red">treated_2</font> <font color="red">controls_2</font> ( p = .06 ) . In 78 children known to be infected with Ascaris at baseline , the rate of weight gain was 21 per cent greater in children treated with <font color="red">levamisole_2</font> <font color="red">than_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">those_1</font> <font color="red">receiving_1</font> <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( p = .03 ) . The rate of height gain was no different for treatment and <font color="red">placebo_1</font> groups .
