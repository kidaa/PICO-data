Clinical effects of root instrumentation using <font color="red">conventional_1</font> <font color="red">steel_1</font> or <font color="red">non_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">tooth_1</font> <font color="red">substance_1</font> <font color="red">removing_1</font> <font color="red">plastic_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> during supportive periodontal therapy ( SPT ) . 
<br>
<br> Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause - related treatment of periodontal diseases , repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth . In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy , <font color="red">non_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">root_2</font> <font color="red">substance_2</font> <font color="red">removing_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> have been developed . However , the clinical effects of such <font color="red">plastic_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established . The aims of this study were , therefore , to compare the effects of root instrumentation using <font color="red">plastic_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Universal_1</font> <font color="red">Perio_1</font> <font color="red">Soft_1</font> <font color="red">Scaler_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Hawe_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Neos_1</font> <font color="red">Dental_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Bioggio_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">TI_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Switzerland_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> versus <font color="red">conventional_1</font> <font color="red">steel_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy . 40 subjects participated in this parallel , randomized , double blind , prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy . 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with <font color="red">conventional_2</font> <font color="red">steel_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> during a supportive periodontal care visit ( SPT ) . The other 20 subjects , the experimental group , were treated using <font color="red">plastic_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> during a similar SPT visit . Clinical parameters , such as bleeding on probing ( BOP ) and probing pocket depth ( PPD ) , were assessed at baseline and 3 - 6 months later at the next regular SPT visit . In addition , the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline . The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time . Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17 - 42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days ( mean BOP baseline : 26% , mean BOP after 10 days : 16% ) . This clinical study suggests that <font color="red">non_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">root_2</font> <font color="red">substance_2</font> <font color="red">removing_2</font> <font color="red">curettes_2</font> may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care , thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth .
