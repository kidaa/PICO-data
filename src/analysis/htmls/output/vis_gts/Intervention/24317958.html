The effect of four different <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> <font color="red">systems_2</font> in the removal of a root canal sealer . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of <font color="red">sonic_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">ultrasonic_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and <font color="red">hydrodynamic_2</font> <font color="red">devices_1</font> in the removal of a root canal sealer from the surface and from simulated irregularities of root canals . 
<br> MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty - three root canals with two standardized grooves in the apical and coronal parts of longitudinally split roots were covered with AH Plus root canal sealer . Compared were the effects of <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">syringe_2</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> ( 1 ) <font color="red">CanalBrush_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> ( 2 ) <font color="red">passive_2</font> <font color="red">ultrasonic_2</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> ( 3 ) <font color="red">EndoActivator_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and ( 4 ) <font color="red">RinsEndo_2</font> on the removal of the sealer . The specimens were divided into four groups ( N   =   12 ) and one control group ( N   =   5 ) via randomization . The amount of remaining sealer in the root canal irregularities was evaluated under a microscope using a 4-grade scoring system , whereas the remaining sealer on the root canal surface was evaluated with a 7-grade scoring system . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Passive_2</font> <font color="red">ultrasonic_2</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> is more effective than the <font color="red">other_1</font> <font color="red">tested_1</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> <font color="red">systems_2</font> or <font color="red">syringe_2</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> in removing sealer from root canal walls ( p   <   0.01 ) . None of the techniques had a significant effect on cleaning the lateral grooves . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of this study protocol <font color="red">ultrasonic_2</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> shows a superior effect on sealer removal from the root canal surface during endodontic retreatment . Cleaning of lateral grooves seems not to be possible with one of the techniques investigated . 
<br> CLINICAL RELEVANCE Incomplete removal of root canal sealer during re - treatment may cause treatment failure . <font color="red">Passive_2</font> <font color="red">Ultrasonic_2</font> <font color="red">irrigation_2</font> seems to be the most effective system to remove sealer from a root canal .
