Analysis of <font color="red">prevention_1</font> <font color="red">program_1</font> effectiveness with clustered data using generalized estimating equations . 
<br>
<br> Experimental studies of <font color="red">prevention_1</font> <font color="red">programs_1</font> often randomize clusters of individuals rather than individuals to treatment conditions . When the correlation among individuals within clusters is not accounted for in statistical analysis , the standard errors are biased , potentially resulting in misleading conclusions about the significance of treatment effects . This study demonstrates the generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) method , focusing specifically on the GEE - independent method , to control for within - cluster correlation in regression models with either continuous or binary outcomes . The GEE - independent method yields consistent and robust variance estimates .
