<br> BACKGROUND The aim of this study was the examination of efficacy and tolerability of an application - form of the new <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">Xylometazoline_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">Dexpanthenol_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">Nasic_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> versus <font color="red">Xylometazoline_2</font> alone . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Randomized verum controlled parallel - group - comparison of two weeks treatment of a nasal - spray . 61 inpatients with the diagnosis Rhinitis following nasal operation were included in this study and 30 patients were treated with <font color="red">verum_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">placebo_2</font> each . The assessment of nasal - breathing - resistance according to scores was defined as target - parameter . Confirmatory statistical analysis was carried out according to Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney - U two - sided at alpha < or = 0.05 . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The superiority of the <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">Xylometazoline_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">Dexpanthenol_2</font> <font color="red">nasal_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">spray_2</font> versus <font color="red">Xylometazoline_2</font> <font color="red">nasal_2</font> <font color="red">spray_2</font> could be proven for the target - parameter as clinically relevant and statistically significant . The clinically proven efficacy is emphasized by good tolerability of both treatments . Due to easy handling of the nasal - spray a good compliance was confirmed . 
<br> CONCLUSION Distinct improvement of symptoms in patients following nasal operations underlines the efficacy of both medications . With respect to the tolerability therapy with the combination is more beneficial in comparison to the alternative therapy . The result of this controlled clinical study confirms that the <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">Xylometazoline_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">Dexpanthenol_2</font> is an enlargement and improvement of effective medicinal treatment of rhinitis following nasal operation in comparison to therapy with <font color="red">Xylometazoline_2</font> alone .
