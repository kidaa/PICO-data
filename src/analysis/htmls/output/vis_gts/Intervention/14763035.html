<br> We investigated whether a <font color="red">selective_2</font> <font color="red">angiotensin_2</font> <font color="red">II_2</font> <font color="red">receptor_2</font> <font color="red">blocker_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">ARB_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> would have a regressive effect on left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . In a double - blind study , 24 CAPD patients with LVH [ left ventricular mass index ( LVMi ) > 110 g / m2 for women and LVMi > 137 g / m2 for men ] were randomized to 12 months ' administration of either the <font color="red">ARB_2</font> <font color="red">valsartan_2</font> ( n = 14 ) or a <font color="red">placebo_1</font> ( n = 10 ) . The target blood pressure ( BP ) was 140/90 mmHg or lower in both groups . The following parameters were measured before and at the end of the study : aortic and large - artery compliance and arterial wave reflections [ pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) and augmentation index ( AI ) application tonometry ] and cardiac echocardiography . Periodically recorded were body weight , BP ( mercury sphygmomanometer ) , serum creatinine , electrolytes , complete blood cell counts , urine volume , drainage volume , and weekly creatinine clearance . Two - way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis . Systolic and diastolic BP were both reduced in patients treated with ARB . The LVMi was significantly reduced in patients treated with <font color="red">ARB_1</font> ( to 121 + /- 4 from 145 + /- 5 ) but not in those receiving <font color="red">placebo_1</font> ( to 137 + /- 3 from 152 + /- 3 , p < 0.05 ) . The decrease in LVMi was associated with a reduction in PWV and AI . In CAPD patients with LVH , <font color="red">ARB_2</font> reduced LVMi in association with alterations in arterial hemodynamics .
