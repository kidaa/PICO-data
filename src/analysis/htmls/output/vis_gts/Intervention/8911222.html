Effects of <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">depletion_1</font> in drug - free adults with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the behavioral and biochemical responses to <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">depletion_1</font> in drug - free adult patients with autistic disorder . 
<br> METHODS Twenty drug - free adults with autistic disorder ( 16 men and 4 women ) ( mean [ + /- SD ] age , 30.5 + /- 8.5 years ) underwent <font color="red">short_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">term_1</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">depletion_1</font> in a double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> controlled , randomized crossover design . Patients received a 24-hour , <font color="red">low_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_2</font> <font color="red">diet_2</font> <font color="red">followed_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">next_1</font> <font color="red">morning_1</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">an_1</font> <font color="red">amino_1</font> <font color="red">acid_1</font> <font color="red">drink_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Behavioral ratings were obtained on the morning of the amino acid drink ( baseline ) and 180 , 300 , and 420 minutes after the drink . Plasma free and total tryptophan levels were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink . The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days . 
<br> RESULTS Eleven ( 65% ) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of behavioral symptoms with <font color="red">short_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">term_1</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">depletion_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in clinical status from baseline after <font color="red">sham_1</font> <font color="red">depletion_1</font> ( P = .001 ) . <font color="red">Tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">depletion_1</font> led to a significant increase in behaviors such as whirling , flapping , pacing , banging and hitting self , rocking , and toe walking ( P < .05 ) . In addition , patients were significantly less calm and happy and more anxious . No significant change was observed in social relatedness or repetitive thoughts and behavior . Plasma total and free tryptophan levels were reduced 86% and 69% , respectively , 5 hours after the <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">deficient_1</font> <font color="red">amino_1</font> <font color="red">acid_1</font> <font color="red">drink_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline plasma total tryptophan levels ( P < .001 ) and Autism Behavior Checklist scores ( P = .005 ) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after tryptophan depletion . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism . These data suggest that the short - term reduction of serotonin precursor availability may exacerbate some symptoms characteristic of autism in some patients . Continued investigation into the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis and treatment of autistic disorder is warranted .
