<font color="red">Antioxidant_2</font> <font color="red">supplementation_2</font> and exercise - induced oxidative stress in the 60-year - old as measured by antipyrine hydroxylates . 
<br>
<br> The effects of 12 weeks of <font color="red">antioxidant_2</font> <font color="red">supplementation_2</font> on exercise - induced oxidative stress were investigated in older adults ( 60 ( SE 1 ) years ; BMI 26 ( SE 1 ) kg / m(2 ) ) . Subjects were randomly divided in two groups : <font color="red">supplementation_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">n_1</font> <font color="red">11_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">100_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">dl_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">alpha_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">tocopheryl_2</font> <font color="red">acetate_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">200_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">ascorbic_2</font> <font color="red">acid_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">2_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">beta_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">carotene_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( n 9 ) . Before and after the 12 week supplementation period , subjects cycled for 45 min at submaximal intensity ( 50 % maximal workload capacity ) . Antipyrine was used as marker for oxidative stress . Antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals to form para- and ortho - hydroxyantipyrine . The latter metabolite is not formed in man through the mono - oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450 . Daily supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of <font color="red">alpha_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">tocopherol_1</font> and <font color="red">beta_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">carotene_1</font> in the <font color="red">supplemented_1</font> group ( Delta 14.4 ( SE 3.2 ) and 0.4 ( se 0.1 ) micromol / l ; P<0.001 and P<0.01 ) . No significant differences , within and between groups , were observed in the exercise - induced increase in the ratios para- and ortho - hydroxyantipyrine to antipyrine . In addition , <font color="red">supplementation_1</font> did not affect the exercise - induced increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in plasma . In conclusion , in 60-year - old subjects <font color="red">antioxidant_2</font> <font color="red">supplementation_2</font> had no effect on the exercise - induced increase in oxidative stress as measured by free radical products of antipyrine .
