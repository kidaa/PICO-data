Phase III study of <font color="red">concurrent_2</font> <font color="red">chemoradiotherapy_3</font> <font color="red">versus_1</font> <font color="red">radiotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">alone_1</font> for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma : positive effect on overall and progression - free survival . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is a radiosensitive and chemosensitive tumor . This randomized phase III trial compared <font color="red">concurrent_2</font> <font color="red">chemoradiotherapy_4</font> <font color="red">(_3</font> <font color="red">CCRT_3</font> <font color="red">)_3</font> <font color="red">versus_2</font> <font color="red">radiotherapy_3</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">RT_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> alone in patients with advanced NPC . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS From December 1993 to April 1999 , 284 patients with 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III to IV ( M0 ) NPC were randomly allocated into two arms . Similar dosage and fractionation of RT was administered in both arms . The investigational arm received two cycles of <font color="red">concurrent_2</font> <font color="red">chemotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">cisplatin_4</font> <font color="red">20_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">m(2)/d_1</font> <font color="red">plus_1</font> <font color="red">fluorouracil_2</font> <font color="red">400_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">m(2)/d_1</font> by 96-hour continuous infusion during the weeks 1 and 5 of RT . Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan - Meier method and compared by the log - rank test . 
<br> RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in both arms . After a median follow - up of 65 months , 26.2% ( 37 of 141 ) and 46.2% ( 66 of 143 ) of patients developed tumor relapse in the <font color="red">CCRT_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">RT_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">alone_2</font> groups , respectively . The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.3% for the <font color="red">CCRT_2</font> arm and 54.2% for the <font color="red">RT_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">only_1</font> <font color="red">arm_1</font> ( P = .0022 ) . The 5-year progression - free survival rates were 71.6% for the <font color="red">CCRT_2</font> group compared with 53.0% for the <font color="red">RT_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> only group ( P = .0012 ) . Although significantly more toxicity was noted in the <font color="red">CCRT_2</font> arm , including leukopenia and emesis , compliance with the combined treatment was good . The second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was refused by nine patients and was delayed for > or = 1 week for another nine patients . There were no treatment - related deaths in either arm . 
<br> CONCLUSION We conclude that <font color="red">CCRT_2</font> is superior to <font color="red">RT_1</font> alone for patients with advanced NPC in endemic areas .
