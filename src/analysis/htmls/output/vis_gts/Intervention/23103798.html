Role of <font color="red">posterior_2</font> <font color="red">tibial_2</font> <font color="red">nerve_2</font> <font color="red">stimulation_2</font> in the treatment of refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis : a pilot study . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE We evaluated the early clinical and urodynamic results of <font color="red">posterior_2</font> <font color="red">tibial_2</font> <font color="red">nerve_2</font> <font color="red">stimulation_2</font> in patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis . 
<br> MATERIALS AND METHODS We randomly assigned 28 patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis to 2 equal groups . Group 1 received a <font color="red">weekly_1</font> <font color="red">session_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">posterior_2</font> <font color="red">tibial_2</font> <font color="red">nerve_2</font> <font color="red">stimulation_2</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">12_1</font> <font color="red">weeks_1</font> and group 2 was the <font color="red">placebo_2</font> group . Evaluation was performed in each group at baseline and after <font color="red">posterior_2</font> <font color="red">tibial_2</font> <font color="red">nerve_2</font> <font color="red">stimulation_2</font> to compare clinical and urodynamic findings . Another clinical assessment was done 3 months after the first followup . 
<br> RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable in baseline clinical and urodynamic data . Overall , 13 patients ( 46.4% ) had detrusor overactivity and 14 ( 50% ) had decreased bladder capacity . After treatment 11 <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">1_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> ( 78.6% ) had a partial or full response to <font color="red">posterior_1</font> <font color="red">tibial_1</font> <font color="red">nerve_1</font> <font color="red">stimulation_1</font> but only 2 ( 14.3% ) in <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">2_1</font> had a partial response ( p = 0.002 ) . Also , the average number of wet nights in group 1 was significantly lower than at baseline ( p = 0.002 ) . All urodynamic parameters significantly improved in group 1 . In contrast , the number of wet nights and urodynamic parameters did not change significantly in group 2 . At 3-month followup the number of patients with a partial or full response in <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">1_1</font> had decreased from 11 ( 78.6% ) to 6 ( 42.9% ) . No change was evident in group 2 . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">Posterior_2</font> <font color="red">tibial_2</font> <font color="red">nerve_2</font> <font color="red">stimulation_2</font> can be a viable treatment option in some patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis . However , deterioration in some responders with time suggests the need for maintenance protocols .
