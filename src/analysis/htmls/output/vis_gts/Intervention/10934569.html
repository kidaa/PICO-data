Randomized trial of <font color="red">intensive_2</font> <font color="red">early_2</font> <font color="red">intervention_2</font> for children with pervasive developmental disorder . 
<br>
<br> Young children with pervasive developmental disorder were randomly assigned to <font color="red">intensive_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_2</font> or <font color="red">parent_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The <font color="red">intensive_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_2</font> group ( 7 with autism , 8 with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified -- NOS ) averaged 24.52 hours per week of individual treatment for one year , gradually reducing hours over the next 1 to 2 years . The <font color="red">parent_2</font> <font color="red">training_2</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( 7 with autism , 6 with pervasive developmental disorder NOS ) received 3 to 9 months of parent training . The groups appeared similar at intake on all measures ; however , at follow - up the <font color="red">intensive_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> group outperformed the <font color="red">parent_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> group on measures of intelligence , visual - spatial skills , language , and academics , though not adaptive functioning or behavior problems . Children with pervasive developmental disorder NOS may have gained more than those with autism .
