Comparison of <font color="red">propofol_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">metoclopramide_2</font> for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting after breast cancer surgery : a prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in Japanese patients . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) . Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy ( with axillary dissection ) experience PONV . We previously reported that <font color="red">propofol_2</font> at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg / kg was more effective than <font color="red">placebo_1</font> in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy . 
<br> OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of <font color="red">propofol_2</font> with the conventional antiemetics <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> and <font color="red">metoclopramide_2</font> for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients . 
<br> METHODS In this prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of <font color="red">propofol_2</font> 0.5 mg / kg , <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> 20 microg / kg , <font color="red">metoclopramide_2</font> 0.2 mg / kg , or <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">isotonic_2</font> <font color="red">saline_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> immediately after skin suture . A standard general anesthetic technique , including sevoflurane and air in oxygen , was used . All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment . The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms . To maintain the integrity of the study results , none of the patients received preanesthetic medication . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 100 women ( mean [ SD ] age , 52 [ 7 ] years ; height , 154 [ 6 ] cm ; weight , 54 [ 7 ] kg ) were included in the study . Each study group comprised 25 patients . There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics , surgery type , or awakening time . The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with <font color="red">propofol_2</font> ( P = 0.005 ) , 32% with <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> ( P = 0.011 ) , and 60% with <font color="red">metoclopramide_2</font> ( P = NS ) , compared with <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( 68% ) . No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving <font color="red">propofol_2</font> and those receiving <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and <font color="red">propofol_2</font> and <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with <font color="red">metoclopramide_2</font> ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.043 , respectively ) . Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The prevalences of PONV were not significantly different between <font color="red">propofol_1</font> 0.5 mg / kg and <font color="red">droperidol_1</font> 20 microg / kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small , select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery . The prevalences of PONV were significantly lower with <font color="red">propofol_2</font> and <font color="red">droperidol_2</font> compared with <font color="red">metoclopramide_2</font> 0.2 mg / kg and <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
