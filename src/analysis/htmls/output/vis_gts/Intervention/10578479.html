Effects of <font color="red">soy_2</font> <font color="red">intake_1</font> on sex hormone metabolism in premenopausal women . 
<br>
<br> Studies suggest that phytoestrogens in <font color="red">soy_1</font> products may impart hormonal effects that protect women against breast cancer . Limited research suggests that intake of <font color="red">soy_1</font> products high in <font color="red">isoflavonoid_1</font> <font color="red">phytoestrogens_1</font> affects sex hormone metabolism , but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in women on common hormone therapies , such as oral contraceptives ( OC ) . We studied the effects of <font color="red">soy_1</font> in 36 premenopausal women , 20 of whom used OC . Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a <font color="red">soy_2</font> <font color="red">beverage_2</font> containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total <font color="red">isoflavones_1</font> to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles . No significant differences were observed in serum estrone , estradiol , sex hormone - binding globulin , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate , prolactin , or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non - OC or the OC group . No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha - hydroxyestrone were seen with <font color="red">soy_1</font> <font color="red">feeding_1</font> in the non - OC or the OC group . Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non - OC and the OC group . Thus <font color="red">soy_2</font> <font color="red">consumption_1</font> had no significant effect on the menstrual cycle , serum sex hormones , or urinary estrogen metabolite ratio in premenopausal OC or non - OC users .
