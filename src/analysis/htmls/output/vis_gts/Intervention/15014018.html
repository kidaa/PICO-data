A pooled analysis of eastern cooperative oncology group and intergroup trials of <font color="red">adjuvant_2</font> <font color="red">high_3</font> <font color="red">-_3</font> <font color="red">dose_3</font> <font color="red">interferon_3</font> for melanoma . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE Nearly 2000 patients with stage IIB and III melanoma have participated in four multicenter , randomized trials , conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Intergroup , investigating <font color="red">adjuvant_2</font> <font color="red">high_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">dose_2</font> <font color="red">IFN_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">alpha_2</font> <font color="red">2b_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The objectives of this study were to update the analyses of each individual trial and to analyze prognostic factors and treatment effects based on pooled data . 
<br> EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Survival and disease status were updated to April 2001 . Analysis of prognostic factors using optimized statistical models was based on data from patients in E1684 , E1690 , E1694 , and E2696 . Analysis of treatment effects versus observation ( Obs ) was based on data from 713 patients randomized to <font color="red">high_3</font> <font color="red">-_3</font> <font color="red">dose_3</font> <font color="red">IFN_4</font> <font color="red">-_4</font> <font color="red">alpha_4</font> <font color="red">2b_4</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">HDI_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">or_2</font> <font color="red">Obs_3</font> in Trials E1684 and E1690 . 
<br> RESULTS Updated analysis of E1684 , E1690 , and E1694 confirmed their original conclusions , now at median follow - up intervals of 2.1 - 12.6 years . Based on two - sided univariate log - rank analysis of pooled data from E1684 and E1690 ( median follow - up , 7.2 years ) , relapse - free survival ( RFS)-but not overall survival ( OS)-was significantly prolonged ( two - sided log - rank P value = 0.006 ) for patients treated with <font color="red">HDI_2</font> <font color="red">versus_1</font> <font color="red">Obs_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Among all patients , prognostic factors that significantly negatively impacted RFS and OS included ulceration , recurrent disease at entry , enrollment in E1684 , and age > 49 years . Multivariate statistical models adjusting for these factors confirmed the statistically significant RFS benefit of <font color="red">HDI_2</font> <font color="red">versus_1</font> <font color="red">Obs_1</font> but did not demonstrate a significant OS benefit in the pooled populations . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In patients with high - risk resected melanoma , <font color="red">HDI_3</font> <font color="red">is_1</font> <font color="red">effective_1</font> <font color="red">adjuvant_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> with strong evidence for improved RFS and evidence for moderate improvement in OS based on two prospective randomized studies but not the pooled analysis . Analyses of predictors of relapse and response are now needed to improve the therapeutic value of this modality .
