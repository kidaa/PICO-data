Safety , tolerability , and immunogenicity after 1 and 2 doses of <font color="red">zoster_2</font> <font color="red">vaccine_2</font> in healthy adults ≥60 years of age . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Incidence and severity of herpes zoster ( HZ ) and postherpetic neuralgia increase with age , associated with age - related decrease in immunity to varicella - zoster virus ( VZV ) . One dose of <font color="red">zoster_2</font> <font color="red">vaccine_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">ZV_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> has demonstrated substantial protection against HZ ; this study examined impact of a <font color="red">second_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">ZV_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS Randomized , double - blind , multicenter study with 210 subjects ≥60 years old compared immunity and safety profiles after <font color="red">one_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">two_1</font> <font color="red">doses_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">ZV_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> separated by 6 weeks , vs. <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Immunogenicity was evaluated using VZV interferon - gamma ( IFN-γ ) enzyme - linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay and VZV glycoprotein enzyme - linked immunosorbent antibody ( gpELISA ) assay . Adverse experiences ( AEs ) were recorded on a standardized Vaccination Report Card . 
<br> RESULTS No serious vaccine - related AEs occurred . VZV IFN-γ ELISPOT geometric mean count ( GMC ) of spot - forming cells per 10(6 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased in the <font color="red">ZV_2</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> from 16.9 prevaccination to 49.5 and 32.8 at 2 and 6 weeks postdose 1 , respectively . Two weeks , 6 weeks and 6 months postdose 2 , GMC was 44.3 , 42.9 , and 36.5 , respectively . GMC in the placebo group did not change during the study . The peak ELISPOT response occurred ∼2 weeks after each <font color="red">ZV_2</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The gpELISA geometric mean titers ( GMTs ) in the <font color="red">ZV_2</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> were higher than in the <font color="red">placebo_1</font> group at 6 weeks after each dose . Correlation between the IFN-γ ELISPOT and gpELISA assays was poor . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">ZV_2</font> was generally well - tolerated and immunogenic in adults ≥60 years old . A <font color="red">second_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">ZV_2</font> was generally safe , but did not boost VZV - specific immunity beyond levels achieved postdose 1 .
