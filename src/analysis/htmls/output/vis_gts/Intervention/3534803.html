Review of the Multicenter Trial Committee report : a prospective , randomized study on the prophylaxis of postoperative deep venous thrombosis . 
<br>
<br> The etiology of postoperative deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) is thought to be due to a combination of factors including stasis , a hypercoagulable state and venous endothelial damage . Methods of prophylaxis are directed toward correcting one or more of these pathologic events . Methods counteracting more than one of these factors can be expected to be even more effective . The combination of <font color="red">dihydroergotamine_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">DHE_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">heparin_1</font> was anticipated to minimize stasis and the hypercoagulable state respectively . Based upon current experimental evidence and current theory , an additional benefit might include minimizing venous endothelial injury by controlling venomotor tone . A prospective , randomized , double - blind , multicenter trial was designed and performed in the United States evaluating the prophylactic efficacy of <font color="red">DHE_2</font> <font color="red">0.5_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">plus_1</font> <font color="red">heparin_2</font> <font color="red">5000_1</font> <font color="red">U_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">DHE_2</font> <font color="red">0.5_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> <font color="red">plus_1</font> <font color="red">heparin_2</font> <font color="red">2500_1</font> <font color="red">U_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">heparin_2</font> <font color="red">5000_1</font> <font color="red">U_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">DHE_2</font> <font color="red">0.5_1</font> <font color="red">mg_1</font> versus <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> General surgical patients including those undergoing noncardiac thoracic and pelvic operations who were identified at moderate to high risk for postop DVT were included . Study medications were injected subcutaneously two hours preoperatively and every 12 hours postoperatively for 5 - 7 days or until the 125I - fibrinogen - uptake test ( RFUT ) became positive . Eight hundred and eighty eight patients were entered into this trial and 744 ( 85% ) completed the study . Results showed a statistically significant benefit from <font color="red">DHE_3</font> <font color="red">/_3</font> <font color="red">Hep_3</font> <font color="red">5000_1</font> compared to <font color="red">placebo_2</font> ( p less than 0.01 ) and compared to other active agents ( p less than 0.05 ) . None of the other active agents showed a statistically significant prophylactic benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
