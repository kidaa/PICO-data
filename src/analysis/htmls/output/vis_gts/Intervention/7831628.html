Measurement of transfer factor during <font color="red">constant_1</font> <font color="red">exhalation_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>

<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Transfer_1</font> <font color="red">factor_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">lung_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">carbon_1</font> <font color="red">monoxide_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">TLCO_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> was measured by a new method based on analysis of the ratio of the concentrations of carbon monoxide to an inert gas ( methane ) relative to lung volume during a constant exhalation . Since this new technique is based solely upon exhalation , anomalies associated with inspiration and breath holding do not affect results . Additionally , because prolonged breath holding is not required , measurements can readily be made in dyspnoeic patients . 
<br> METHODS <font color="red">Exhalation_2</font> <font color="red">TLCO_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">TLCO_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">ex_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> was compared with the <font color="red">standard_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Jones_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">Meade_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">10_1</font> <font color="red">second_1</font> <font color="red">breath_1</font> <font color="red">holding_1</font> <font color="red">TLCO_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">TLCO_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">bh_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> in 100 consecutive patients . Patients did not practise the exhalation manoeuvre prior to testing . 
<br> RESULTS The comparative results were very close ; mean difference ( bias ) + /- standard deviation ( precision ) was 0.05 ( 0.84 ) mmol / min / kPa . The relation was equally strong in patients with severe pulmonary disease ; for patients with FEV1 < 1.51 the mean difference was 0.21 ( 0.80 ) mmol / min / kPa . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Since the results were essentially identical between the techniques , it seems that comparable pathophysiological factors affect <font color="red">TLCO_1</font> during <font color="red">breath_1</font> <font color="red">holding_1</font> and <font color="red">constant_1</font> <font color="red">exhalation_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Constant_1</font> <font color="red">exhalation_1</font> may therefore be a useful alternative to the breath holding technique for clinical measurement of <font color="red">TLCO_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
