The immediate efficacy of <font color="red">adjunctive_1</font> <font color="red">doxycycline_2</font> in treatment of localized juvenile periodontitis . 
<br>
<br> A randomized , double - blind , <font color="red">placebo_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> controlled study on the immediate clinical and microbiological efficacy of <font color="red">doxycycline_2</font> ( 100 mg for 14 days ) was carried out to determine the benefit of adjunctive medication in 16 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis . Measurements of gingival fluid flow , probing depths , bleeding on probing and suppuration were determined at 2 periodontal sites with and 2 without radiographic attachment loss , at weeks 0 , 1 , 3 and 8 . Subgingival bacterial samples were taken with curettes from the same sites . Spirochaetes were searched for by dark - field microscopy . Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , pigmented and non - pigmented Bacteroides spp . , Capnocytophaga , Fusobacterium and Actinomyces spp . were cultured on various selective and non - selective media . Bacterial species found at least in 50% of the patients and comprising on average 5% or more of the cultivable flora were included in the analysis . Neither short - term clinical nor microbiological efficacy beyond that of a course of mechanical debridement alone was found by using systemic medication with <font color="red">doxycycline_2</font> in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis .
