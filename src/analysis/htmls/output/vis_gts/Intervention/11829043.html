A pilot study on the effect of <font color="red">progressive_4</font> <font color="red">muscle_4</font> <font color="red">relaxation_4</font> <font color="red">training_4</font> of patients after <font color="red">stoma_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> Eighteen patients who had undergone stoma surgery were assessed with respect to their anxiety level and self - reported quality of life ( QoL ) on three occasions ; namely , immediately after surgery , 5 weeks after <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and 10 weeks after <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The patients were randomised into a <font color="red">control_3</font> <font color="red">group_2</font> ( n = 10 ) and an <font color="red">experimental_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( n = 8) . A <font color="red">20-min_2</font> <font color="red">set_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">audiotaped_5</font> <font color="red">instructions_5</font> <font color="red">on_5</font> <font color="red">progressive_5</font> <font color="red">muscle_5</font> <font color="red">relaxation_5</font> <font color="red">training_5</font> <font color="red">(_3</font> <font color="red">PMRT_3</font> <font color="red">)_3</font> was given to the patients in the experimental group for home practice . Assessment instructions included the Chinese State - Trait Anxiety Inventory ( C - STAI ) , the Quality of Life Index for Colostomy ( QoL - Colostomy ) and the Hong Kong Chinese version of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale ( WHOQoL ) . Results indicated that there was a significant decrease in both the C - STAI score ( F = 4.66 , P < 0.05 ) and the WHOQoL score ( F = 4.74 , P < 0.05 ) in the experimental group . Among the domains of WHOQoL , a significant difference was shown in physical health / independence and general perception of QoL , with the experimental group demonstrating better functioning . For the QoL - Colostomy , however , there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups . The results suggest that the use of <font color="red">PMRT_2</font> could enhance quality of life and decrease state anxiety in patients after stoma surgery .
