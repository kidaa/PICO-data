Additive IOP - reducing effect of <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> in patients insufficiently controlled on <font color="red">timolol_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To evaluate the effect on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of switching from <font color="red">timolol_2</font> to <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> or adding <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> to <font color="red">timolol_2</font> in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension where IOP is not adequately controlled with timolol . 
<br> METHODS This was a 6-week , double - masked , randomised multi - centre study . 53 patients with primary open angle glaucoma , capsular glaucoma , or ocular hypertension with an IOP of at least 21 mmHg on current therapy were recruited . After a run - in period of at least 2 weeks on <font color="red">timolol_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 5 mg / ml twice daily , patients were randomised to one of three groups . One group continued on <font color="red">timolol_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> one switched from <font color="red">timolol_2</font> to <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> 50 microg / ml once daily , and a third group received <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> in addition to <font color="red">timolol_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The efficacy was evaluated by comparing IOP at 9 AM at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment . 
<br> RESULTS IOP at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment ( mean + /- SEM ) were 24.2 + /- 0.9 and 23.8 + /- 1.0 mmHg ( n = 16 ) for patients continuing on <font color="red">timolol_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> 26.3 + /- 1.2 and 19.6 + /- 1.1 mmHg ( n = 17 ) for patients switching to <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and 23.2 + /- 1.0 and 17.5 + /- 0.8 mmHg ( n = 17 ) for patients with <font color="red">combined_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Adding <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> to <font color="red">timolol_2</font> reduced IOP with 5.9 + /- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) and switching from <font color="red">timolol_2</font> to <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> reduced IOP with 5.0 + /- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) , which caused in each group a significant IOP reduction of about 25% . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The effect of <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> was additive to that of <font color="red">timolol_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and a good effect on IOP reduction was also achieved by switching from <font color="red">timolol_2</font> to <font color="red">latanoprost_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
