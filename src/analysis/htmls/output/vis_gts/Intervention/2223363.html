<br>
<br> The effect of changing the <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">infusion_1</font> of <font color="red">propofol_3</font> for induction of anaesthesia was studied in 60 elderly patients . <font color="red">Propofol_5</font> was administered at 300 , 600 or 1200 ml h-1 until loss of consciousness ( as judged by loss of verbal contact with the patient ) had been achieved . The duration of induction was significantly longer ( P less than 0.001 ) with the slower infusion rates ( 104 , 68 and 51 s ) , but the total dose used was significantly less ( P less than 0.001 ) in these patients ( 1.2 , 1.6 and 2.5 mg kg-1 , respectively ) . The decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was significantly less in the 300-ml h-1 group at the end of induction and immediately after induction ( P less than 0.01 ) . The incidence of apnoea was also significantly less in the slower infusion group .
