Randomized controlled trial of <font color="red">acupuncture_2</font> versus <font color="red">sham_2</font> <font color="red">acupuncture_2</font> in autism spectrum disorder . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE We aim to study the efficacy of <font color="red">acupuncture_2</font> versus <font color="red">sham_2</font> <font color="red">acupuncture_2</font> in children with autism spectrum disorder . 
<br> METHODS A single - blind randomized control trial was conducted in 50 children . These children were randomly assigned to the treatment group with <font color="red">tongue_2</font> <font color="red">acupuncture_2</font> ( 40 sessions over 8 weeks ) or the <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( <font color="red">sham_1</font> <font color="red">tongue_1</font> <font color="red">acupuncture_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">nonacupoints_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">tongue_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> . 
<br> RESULTS There was improvement in both the <font color="red">treatment_1</font> and <font color="red">control_1</font> groups in all assessed measures but more so in the <font color="red">treatment_1</font> than in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group : ( 1 ) eye - hand coordination , performance , and practical reasoning of Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale ; ( 2 ) sensory - motor , social , affectual , language , and total score of Ritvo - Freeman Real Life Scale ; ( 3 ) Comprehension Language age in the Reynell Language Developmental Scale ; and ( 4 ) Total Score and Mental Age in Symbolic Play Test . The only statistically significant improvement in the <font color="red">treatment_1</font> as compared to the <font color="red">control_1</font> group was seen in self - care and cognition domains of the Functional Independence Measure for children . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS We had demonstrated that a short course of <font color="red">acupuncture_2</font> had efficacy in improving various developmental and behavioral aspects of children with autism . The long - term efficacy in functional gain needs to be further explored .
