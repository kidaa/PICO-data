Economic evaluation of <font color="red">aquatic_3</font> <font color="red">exercise_3</font> for persons with osteoarthritis . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation <font color="red">aquatic_3</font> <font color="red">exercise_3</font> <font color="red">classes_3</font> from the societal perspective . 
<br> DESIGN Randomized trial of 20-week <font color="red">aquatic_3</font> <font color="red">classes_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font> Cost per quality - adjusted life year ( QALY ) gained was estimated using trial data . Sample size was based on 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost / QALY gained would not exceed $ 50,000 . 
<br> SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor - confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to <font color="red">participate_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">aquatic_2</font> <font color="red">classes_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The Quality of Well - Being Scale ( QWB ) and Current Health Desirability Rating ( CHDR ) were used for economic evaluation , supplemented by the arthritis - specific Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale ( CES - D ) , and Perceived Quality of Life Scale ( PQOL ) collected at baseline and postclass . Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs . Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries / questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs . Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs / QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Aquatic_1</font> <font color="red">exercisers_1</font> reported equal ( QWB ) or better ( CHDR , HAQ , PQOL ) health - related quality of life compared with <font color="red">controls_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Outcomes improved with regular class attendance . Costs / QALY gained discounted at 3% were $ 205,186 using the QWB and $ 32,643 using the CHRD . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">Aquatic_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> exceeded $ 50,000 per QALY gained using the community - weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant - weighted measure . Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of <font color="red">aquatic_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
