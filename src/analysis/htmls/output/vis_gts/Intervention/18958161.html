Neural basis of self and other representation in autism : an FMRI study of self - face recognition . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by decreased interest and engagement in social interactions and by enhanced self - focus . While previous theoretical approaches to understanding autism have emphasized social impairments and altered interpersonal interactions , there is a recent shift towards understanding the nature of the representation of the self in individuals with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) . Still , the neural mechanisms subserving self - representations in ASD are relatively unexplored . 
<br> METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used event - related fMRI to investigate brain responsiveness to images of the subjects ' own face and to faces of others . Children with ASD and typically developing ( TD ) children viewed <font color="red">randomly_1</font> <font color="red">presented_1</font> <font color="red">digital_1</font> <font color="red">morphs_1</font> <font color="red">between_1</font> <font color="red">their_1</font> <font color="red">own_1</font> <font color="red">face_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">gender_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">matched_1</font> <font color="red">other_1</font> <font color="red">face_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and made " self / other " judgments . Both groups of children activated a right premotor / prefrontal system when identifying images containing a greater percentage of the self face . However , while TD children showed activation of this system during both self- and other - processing , children with ASD only recruited this system while viewing images containing mostly their own face . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE This functional dissociation between the representation of self versus others points to a potential neural substrate for the characteristic self - focus and decreased social understanding exhibited by these individuals , and suggests that individuals with ASD lack the shared neural representations for self and others that TD children and adults possess and may use to understand others .
