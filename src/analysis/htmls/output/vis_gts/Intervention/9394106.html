Effect of treatment with <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease -- a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> The results of experimental and clinical studies support the hypothesis that gut - derived endotoxins might be of relevance for the development and course of alcoholic liver disease . The aim of this study was to test the effect of a nonabsorbable , broad - spectrum antibiotic on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease . Fifty patients with alcoholic liver disease ( 27 with cirrhosis , 23 without cirrhosis ) were randomly assigned to receive either <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> <font color="red">sulfate_1</font> ( 3 x 1 g / day ) or <font color="red">placebo_1</font> in a double - blind fashion for at least 3 weeks , and if possible 4 weeks . Endotoxin concentration , liver function tests , and other laboratory parameters were determined in weekly intervals . Endotoxin concentration was also determined in 15 healthy controls . Groups receiving <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> or <font color="red">placebo_1</font> were similar for clinical and biological items collected initially . Mean initial endotoxin concentrations were significantly elevated in both groups ( mean + /- SEM ; <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 16.7 + /- 5.3 pg / ml ; <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 17.5 + /- 6.9 pg / ml ; healthy controls , 2.3 + /- 0.4 pg / ml ) . Although the mean endotoxin concentration was lower in the verum group after 1 week ( <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 8.0 + /- 1.9 pg / ml ; <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> 14.6 + /- 3.5 pg / ml ; p > 0.05 ) , <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> treatment had no significant effect on endotoxin concentration or liver function tests during the 4-week period . The beneficial effect of <font color="red">paromomycin_1</font> treatment on endotoxemia in cirrhotics reported in earlier studies could not be reproduced under the conditions of this trial in patients with alcoholic liver disease .
