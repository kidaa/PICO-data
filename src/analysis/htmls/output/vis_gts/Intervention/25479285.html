Randomised trial of <font color="red">text_2</font> <font color="red">messaging_2</font> on adherence to cardiovascular preventive treatment ( INTERACT trial ) . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND About one third of patients prescribed blood pressure or lipid - lowering drugs for the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke do not take their medication as prescribed . We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate <font color="red">text_2</font> <font color="red">messaging_2</font> as a means of improving adherence to cardiovascular disease preventive treatment . 
<br> METHODS 303 patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid - lowering medications were randomly assigned to <font color="red">being_1</font> <font color="red">sent_1</font> <font color="red">text_2</font> <font color="red">messages_2</font> ( Text group , 151 ) or <font color="red">not_1</font> <font color="red">being_1</font> <font color="red">sent_1</font> <font color="red">them_1</font> ( <font color="red">No_1</font> <font color="red">text_1</font> group , 152 ) . <font color="red">Texts_1</font> were sent daily for 2 weeks , alternate days for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter for 22 weeks ( 6 months overall ) , using an automated computer programme . Patients were asked to respond on whether they had taken their medication , whether the text reminded them to do so if they had forgotten , and if they had not taken their medication to determine if there was a reason for not doing so . At 6 months , use of medication was assessed . 
<br> RESULTS Two patients were lost to follow - up , providing data on 301 for analysis . In the <font color="red">No_1</font> <font color="red">text_1</font> group 38/151 ( 25% ) took less than 80% of the prescribed regimen ( ie . stopped medication completely or took it on fewer than 22 of the last 28 days of follow - up ) compared to 14/150 patients ( 9% ) in the <font color="red">Text_1</font> group - an improvement in adherence affecting 16 per 100 patients ( 95% CI 7 to 24 ) , p<0.001 . The <font color="red">texts_1</font> reminded 98/151 patients ( 65% ) to take medication on at least one occasion and lead to 20/151 ( 13% ) who stopped taking medication because of concern over efficacy or side - effects , resuming treatment . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In patients taking blood pressure or lipid - lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , <font color="red">text_2</font> <font color="red">messaging_2</font> improved medication adherence compared with <font color="red">no_2</font> <font color="red">text_2</font> <font color="red">messaging_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
