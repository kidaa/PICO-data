Effects of <font color="red">cuff_1</font> <font color="red">inflation_1</font> on self - recorded blood pressure . 
<br>
<br> Changes in continuously recorded ' Finapres ' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by <font color="red">self_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">inflation_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">cuff_2</font> or just <font color="red">wearing_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">inflated_2</font> <font color="red">cuff_2</font> were studied . <font color="red">Inflating_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">cuff_1</font> caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg ( hypertensive and normotensive subjects , respectively ) . <font color="red">Wearing_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">inflated_1</font> <font color="red">cuff_1</font> did not change blood pressure . Thus the rise in pressure was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation . Systolic blood pressure took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation . Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10 - 15 s when following recommended procedures , self - recorded systolic blood pressure may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast .
