<br> This study was conducted to determine the long - term effect of <font color="red">flosequinan_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> a new orally administered arterial and venous dilator , on the clinical course of patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure . Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either <font color="red">flosequinan_4</font> ( n = 9 ) or <font color="red">placebo_4</font> ( n = 8) in a double - blind fashion . Changes in symptomatology , exercise performance , and left ventricular function were assessed serially during the two - month treatment period . During the course of therapy , a modest improvement in the symptom scores and functional classification of the <font color="red">flosequinan_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> treated patients was observed . <font color="red">Flosequinan_2</font> evoked a significant increase in maximal exercise capacity . While long - term <font color="red">flosequinan_2</font> administration also effected a progressive increase in resting heart rate , it did not consistently improve indices of left ventricular systolic function . The addition of <font color="red">chronic_1</font> <font color="red">vasodilator_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">flosequinan_2</font> to standard digitalis - diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure . Trials involving larger patient populations will be necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary study and to determine the extent of clinical improvement , subpopulations benefited , role in heart failure therapeutics , and so forth .
