Phase III study of two different dosing schedules of <font color="red">erythropoietin_2</font> in anemic patients with cancer . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare <font color="red">maintenance_1</font> <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> administered once every 3 weeks with continued <font color="red">weekly_1</font> <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> for patients with cancer - associated anemia . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive <font color="red">three_1</font> <font color="red">weekly_1</font> <font color="red">doses_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> <font color="red">40,000_1</font> <font color="red">U_1</font> <font color="red">subcutaneously_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">SC_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> followed by either <font color="red">standard_1</font> <font color="red">weekly_1</font> <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">40_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> <font color="red">arm_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> or <font color="red">120,000_1</font> <font color="red">U_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">120_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> <font color="red">arm_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks . 
<br> RESULTS Three hundred sixty - five patients were enrolled . One hundred eighty - three patients were assigned to the <font color="red">40_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm , and 182 were assigned to the <font color="red">120_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm . There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study ( 23% in <font color="red">40_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm and 18% in <font color="red">120_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm , P = .22 ) or specifically during the maintenance phase ( 13% in <font color="red">40_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm v 15% in <font color="red">120_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm , P = .58 ) . Patients randomly assigned to the <font color="red">40_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g / dL hemoglobin ( Hb ) increment , were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb , and had higher mean end - of - study Hb levels . Toxicities , including thromboembolism , and overall survival were similar . Patients in the <font color="red">40_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm had a higher global quality of life ( QOL ) at baseline for unclear reasons , whereas patients in the <font color="red">120_1</font> <font color="red">K_1</font> arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study , so end - of - study QOL was equivalent . 
<br> CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> 40,000 U , a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing transfusion needs or sacrificing QOL . The Hb increment is somewhat greater with continued weekly <font color="red">epoetin_2</font> <font color="red">alfa_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results .
