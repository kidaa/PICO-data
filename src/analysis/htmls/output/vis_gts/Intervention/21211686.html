Lowering the triglyceride / high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio is associated with the beneficial impact of <font color="red">pioglitazone_2</font> on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in diabetic patients : insights from the PERISCOPE ( <font color="red">Pioglitazone_1</font> Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation ) study . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with the favorable effect of <font color="red">pioglitazone_1</font> on atheroma progression . 
<br> BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated coronary atheroma progression . <font color="red">Pioglitazone_2</font> slowed progression compared with <font color="red">glimepiride_1</font> in this population . 
<br> METHODS In all , 360 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease were treated with <font color="red">pioglitazone_2</font> or <font color="red">glimepiride_2</font> for 18 months in the PERISCOPE ( <font color="red">Pioglitazone_1</font> Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation ) study . Coronary atheroma progression was evaluated by serial intravascular ultrasound . The relationship between changes in biochemical parameters , percent atheroma volume , and total atheroma volume was investigated . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Pioglitazone_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> treated patients demonstrated greater increases in high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) and reductions in glycated hemoglobin , triglycerides , and C - reactive protein . Significant correlations were observed between changes in percent atheroma volume and triglycerides ( r = 0.15 , p = 0.04 ) , triglyceride / HDL - C ratio ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.03 ) , and glycated hemoglobin ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.03 ) with <font color="red">pioglitazone_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and changes in low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( r = -0.15 , p = 0.05 ) , apolipoprotein B ( r = -0.16 , p = 0.04 ) , and apolipoprotein A - I ( r = -0.20 , p = 0.01 ) with <font color="red">glimepiride_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Substantial atheroma regression , compared to progression , was associated with greater relative increases in HDL - C ( 14.2% vs. 7.8% , p = 0.04 ) , relative decreases in triglycerides ( -13.3% vs. -1.9% , p = 0.045 ) , triglyceride / HDL - C ratio ( -22.5 vs. -9.9% , p = 0.05 ) , and decrease in glycated hemoglobin ( -0.6% vs. -0.3% , p = 0.01 ) . Multivariable analysis revealed that <font color="red">pioglitazone_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> induced effects on triglyceride / HDL - C were associated with changes in percent atheroma volume ( p = 0.03 ) and total atheroma volume ( p = 0.02 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Favorable effects of <font color="red">pioglitazone_2</font> on the triglyceride / HDL - C ratio correlated with delayed atheroma progression in diabetic patients . This finding highlights the potential importance of targeting atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease .
