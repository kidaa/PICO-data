<br> OBJECTIVE To study the clinical efficacy of the <font color="red">laparoscopic_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">Quyu_2</font> <font color="red">Jiedu_2</font> <font color="red">Recipe_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">QYJDR_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> on endometriosis ( EMs)-related infertility patients . 
<br> METHODS 130 EMs - related infertility patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to two groups , i.e. , the <font color="red">test_1</font> group ( 75 cases ) and the <font color="red">control_1</font> group ( 55 cases ) . All patients received routine progesterone treatment after laparoscopic surgery . <font color="red">QYJDR_2</font> was given to patients in the <font color="red">test_1</font> group after laparoscopic surgery , lasting for twelve months . The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups . The Chinese medicine syndrome integrals , serum endometrium antibody ( EMAb ) and cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) levels were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy . 
<br> RESULTS The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the <font color="red">test_1</font> group than in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group [ 61.33% ( 46/75 ) vs 45.45% ( 25/55 ) ] , showing significant difference ( P<0.05 ) . The Chinese medicine syndrome integral was ( 16.07 + /- 6.77 ) score and ( 7.25 + /- 3.27 ) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the <font color="red">test_1</font> group , while it was ( 15.92 + /- 7.51 ) score and ( 12.73 + /- 6.12 ) score in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group . The Chinese medicine syndrome integral after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group . Besides , the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the <font color="red">test_1</font> group than in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group [ ( 9.12 + /- 6.16 ) score vs ( 3.48 + /- 2.06 ) score ) ] , showing statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . After three - month drug therapy , the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the <font color="red">test_1</font> group than in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group ( 44.44% vs 15.62% ) , showing statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . The serum CA125 level was ( 31.88 + /- 15.78 ) U / mL before drug therapy and ( 18.82 + /- 10.08 ) U / mL three months after drug therapy in the <font color="red">test_1</font> group , while it was ( 30.63 + /- 19.28 ) U / mL and ( 18.05 + /- 11.20 ) U / mL respectively in the <font color="red">control_1</font> group . It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy ( P>0.05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The <font color="red">laparoscopic_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">combination_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">QYJDR_2</font> could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome , promote negative conversion of EMAb , lower serum CA125 levels , and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate . <font color="red">QYJDR_2</font> is an effective formula in treatment of EMs - related infertility .
