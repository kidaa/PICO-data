<br>
<br> This study examined the efficacy and safety of <font color="red">nifedipine_2</font> <font color="red">sustained_2</font> <font color="red">release_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">nifedipine_2</font> <font color="red">SR_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> compared with <font color="red">Ginkgo_2</font> <font color="red">biloba_2</font> <font color="red">extract_2</font> as treatment for primary Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) in Korea . Primary RP were screened and assigned to either the <font color="red">nifedipine_2</font> <font color="red">SR_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( Group N ) or the <font color="red">Ginkgo_2</font> <font color="red">biloba_2</font> <font color="red">extract_2</font> group ( Group G ) in the ratio of 2:1 . After a run - in period of 2 weeks , patients received treatment for 8 weeks . We observed the percent improvement of the RP attack rate between before and after the 8-week treatment . Ninety - three subjects were randomly assigned . The percent improvement in Group N was 50.1% at 8 weeks after treatment , while it was 31.0% in Group G ( p = 0.03 ) . No serious adverse events occurred , and almost adverse events were mild and improved without specific treatment . <font color="red">nifedipine_2</font> <font color="red">SR_2</font> was more effective than <font color="red">Ginkgo_2</font> <font color="red">biloba_2</font> <font color="red">extract_2</font> for treatment of primary RP in Korean patients . Both drugs were tolerable with primary RP patients .
