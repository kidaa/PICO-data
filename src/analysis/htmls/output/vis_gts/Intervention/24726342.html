Assessment of acute <font color="red">bronchodilator_1</font> effects from specific airway resistance changes in stable COPD patients . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND In COPD patients , reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s ( ΔFEV1 ) and forced vital capacity ( ΔFVC ) . By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone , <font color="red">bronchodilators_1</font> should decrease dynamic hyperinflation , gas trapping , and possibly dyspnea at rest . Hence , we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes ( ΔsRAW ) should better characterize the acute response to <font color="red">bronchodilators_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS On two days , 60 COPD patients underwent dyspnea evaluation ( VAS score ) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after <font color="red">placebo_1</font> or 300μg <font color="red">indacaterol_1</font> administration . 
<br> RESULTS Spirographic and ΔsRAW - based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients , respectively . ΔsRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume ( ΔITGV ) ( r=0.61 ; p<0.001 ) , residual volume ( ΔRV ) ( r=0.60 ; p<0.001 ) , ΔFVC ( r=0.44 ; p=0.001 ) , and ΔVAS ( r=0.73 ; p<0.001 ) , while ΔFEV1 correlated only with ΔFVC ( r=0.34 ; p=0.008 ) . Significant differences in terms of ΔITGV ( p=0.002 ) , ΔRV ( p=0.023 ) , and ΔVAS ( p<0.001 ) occurred only if patients were stratified according to ΔsRAW . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In assessing the acute functional effect of <font color="red">bronchodilators_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> ΔsRAW - based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC - based criteria , being more closely related to bronchodilator - induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest .
