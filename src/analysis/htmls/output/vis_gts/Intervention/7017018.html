Bacteremia due to Bacteroides fragilis after <font color="red">elective_2</font> <font color="red">appendectomy_2</font> in renal transplant recipients . 
<br>
<br> Bacteremia caused by Bacteroides fragilis occurred in four of 75 children after <font color="red">renal_1</font> <font color="red">transplantation_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and B. fragilis was the most common cause of postoperative bacteremia . Bacteroides bacteremia was significantly associated with performance of <font color="red">elective_2</font> <font color="red">appendectomy_2</font> at the time of transplantation ( P less than 0.01 ) and with profound lymphocytopenia ( P = 0.01 ) . No patient received antibiotics at the time of surgery or prior to the first positive blood culture , yet B. fragilis was the single organism isolated from blood and abscesses in these patients . A role for lymphocytes in containment of B. fragilis has not been suggested previously , although unexplained occurrence of bacteroides bacteremia in immunocompromised patients has occasionally been reported . Lymphocytes themselves may be important in this host - bacterium interaction , or lymphocytopenia may be the marker for a more generalized deficiency in host defenses .
