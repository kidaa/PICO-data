<br> BACKGROUND Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) impacts <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">QoL_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for intervention . 
<br> METHODS Our study was a prospective , randomised control trial . Fifty - six outpatients were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a waiting - list control group . Treatment group patients attended three relaxation - training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice . Evaluations performed pre and post - treatment : <font color="red">state_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> was assessed with the <font color="red">State_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Trait_1</font> <font color="red">Anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">Inventory_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">QoL_1</font> with the <font color="red">IBD_1</font> <font color="red">Questionnaire_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The <font color="red">Visual_1</font> <font color="red">Analogue_1</font> <font color="red">Scale_1</font> assessed <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">depression_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">stress_1</font> and <font color="red">mood_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Patients completed a symptom monitoring diary . The control group 's symptoms were monitored without study - related treatment . 
<br> RESULTS Thirty - nine subjects completed the study and were included in the data analysis . Following the relaxation - training intervention , the treatment group 's ( n   =   18 ) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as compared to the control group ( n   =   21 ) ( time by treatment interaction ) : <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> decreased ( p   <   0.01 ) , <font color="red">QoL_1</font> and <font color="red">mood_1</font> improved ( p   <   0.05 ) , while levels of <font color="red">pain_1</font> and <font color="red">stress_1</font> decreased ( p   <   0.01 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Findings indicate IBD patients may benefit from relaxation training in their holistic care . New studies as well as further investigation of the subject are warranted .
