<br> The aim of the present study was to investigate the <font color="red">effects_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">various_1</font> <font color="red">anaesthetic_1</font> <font color="red">procedures_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">endocrine_1</font> <font color="red">stress_1</font> <font color="red">responses_1</font> during ear microsurgical operations . Simple mastoidectomies , radical mastoidectomies and tympano plastics were carried out in 49 patients under the following randomised anaesthetic procedures : Group 1 halothane anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin ( n = 14 ) , Group 2 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin ( n = 10 ) , Group 3 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine ( n = 14 ) , and Group 4 retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with prilocaine and epinephrine ( n = 14 ) . The plasma levels of epinephrine , norepinephrine , glucose , lactate and free glycerol were measured in addition to mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ) immediately before anaesthesia , 10 minutes after skin incision , 10 minutes after having started bone drilling , at the end of the operation and 3 hours after operation . All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor .

There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR . The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a <font color="red">direct_1</font> <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">stress_1</font> followed by a <font color="red">secondary_1</font> <font color="red">change_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">glucose_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">lactate_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">glycerol_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The beneficial effect of general anaesthesia is documented by normal plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
