Use of hormonal contraceptives and risk of HIV-1 transmission : a prospective cohort study . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Hormonal contraceptives are used widely but their effects on HIV-1 risk are unclear . We aimed to <font color="red">assess_1</font> the association between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from HIV-1-infected women to their male partners . 
<br> METHODS In this prospective study , we followed up 3790 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples participating in two longitudinal studies of HIV-1 incidence in seven African countries . Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non - users , we compared rates of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men . The primary outcome measure was <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> <font color="red">seroconversion_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> We used <font color="red">Cox_1</font> <font color="red">proportional_1</font> <font color="red">hazards_1</font> <font color="red">regression_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">marginal_1</font> <font color="red">structural_1</font> <font color="red">modelling_1</font> to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk . 
<br> FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was female ( median follow - up 18·0 [ IQR 12·6 - 24·2 ] months ) , <font color="red">rates_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">HIV-1_2</font> <font color="red">acquisition_2</font> were 6·61 per 100 person - years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3·78 per 100 person - years in those who did not ( adjusted hazard ratio 1·98 , 95% CI 1·06 - 3·68 , p=0·03 ) . Among 2476 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male ( median follow - up 18·7 [ IQR 12·8 - 24·2 ] months ) , <font color="red">rates_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">HIV-1_2</font> <font color="red">transmission_2</font> <font color="red">from_1</font> <font color="red">women_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">men_1</font> were 2·61 per 100 person - years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1·51 per 100 person - years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception ( adjusted hazard ratio 1·97 , 95% CI 1·12 - 3·45 , p=0·02 ) . Marginal structural model analyses generated much the same results to the Cox proportional hazards regression . 
<br> INTERPRETATION Women should be counselled about potentially increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission with hormonal contraception , especially injectable methods , and about the importance of dual protection with condoms to decrease HIV-1 risk . Non - hormonal or low - dose hormonal contraceptive methods should be considered for women with or at - risk for HIV-1 .
