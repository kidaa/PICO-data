<br>
<br> In order to investigate the effect of anesthesia on <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">parameters_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) were blood - sampled immediately without anesthesia ( control ) or subjected to following anesthesia procedure : 40 , 120 , and 240 s exposure to 3,000 , 700 , and 500 mg l⁻¹ clove solution , respectively . Blood samples were collected after these periods , when fish were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia . Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control . <font color="red">Serum_1</font> <font color="red">lactate_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> were significantly high in 500 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control group . <font color="red">Lactate_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> were not significantly differed between control , 3,000 , and 700 mg l⁻¹ groups .
