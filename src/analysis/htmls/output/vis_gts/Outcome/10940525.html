<font color="red">Efficacy_1</font> and <font color="red">safety_1</font> of selamectin against fleas and heartworms in dogs and cats presented as veterinary patients in North America . 
<br>
<br> A series of randomized , controlled , masked field studies was conducted to assess the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> and <font color="red">safety_1</font> of selamectin in the treatment of flea infestations on dogs and cats , and in the <font color="red">prevention_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">heartworm_1</font> <font color="red">infection_1</font> in dogs . In addition , observations were made on the beneficial effect of selamectin treatment on dogs and cats showing signs of flea allergy dermatitis ( FAD ) . In all studies selamectin was applied topically , once per month , in unit doses providing a minimum dosage of 6mgkg(-1 ) . Dogs and cats with naturally occurring flea infestations , some of which also had signs associated with FAD , were assigned randomly to receive three months of topical treatment with selamectin ( 220 dogs , 189 cats ) or a positive - control product ( dogs : fenthion , n=81 ; cats : pyrethrins , n=66 ) . Selamectin was administered on days 0 , 30 , and 60 . Day 0 was defined as the day that the animal first received treatment . Flea burdens were assessed by <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">comb_1</font> <font color="red">counts_1</font> and <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">evaluations_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">FAD_1</font> were performed before treatment , and on days 14 , 30 , 60 , and 90 . On days 30 , 60 , and 90 , <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">counts_1</font> in selamectin - treated dogs were reduced by 92.1 , 99.0 , and 99.8% , and <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">counts_1</font> in fenthion - treated dogs were reduced by 81.5 , 86.8 , and 86.1% , respectively , compared with day 0 counts . Also , on days 30 , 60 , and 90 , <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">counts_1</font> in selamectin - treated cats were reduced by 92.5 , 98.3 , and 99.3% , and <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">counts_1</font> in pyrethrin - treated cats were reduced by 66.4 , 73.9 , and 81.3% , respectively , compared with day 0 counts . Selamectin also was beneficial in alleviating signs in dogs and cats diagnosed clinically with FAD . A total of 397 dogs free of adult heartworm infection from four heartworm - endemic areas of the USA were allocated randomly to six months of treatment with selamectin ( n=298 ) or ivermectin ( n=99 ) . Selamectin achieved a <font color="red">heartworm_1</font> <font color="red">prevention_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> of 100% , with all dogs testing negative for <font color="red">microfilariae_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">heartworm_1</font> <font color="red">antigen_1</font> on days 180 and 300 . Selamectin was administered to a total of 673 dogs and 347 cats having an age range of 6 weeks to 19 years ( 3954 doses ) . The animals included 19 purebred or crossbred Collies ( Bearded , Border , and unspecified ) . There were no serious <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Results of these studies indicated that selamectin was highly effective in the <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">infestations_1</font> in dogs and cats without the need for simultaneous treatment of the environment or of in - contact animals and also was beneficial in alleviating <font color="red">signs_1</font> <font color="red">associated_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">FAD_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Selamectin also was 100% effective in <font color="red">preventing_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">development_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">canine_1</font> <font color="red">heartworms_1</font> and was <font color="red">safe_1</font> for topical use in dogs and cats .
