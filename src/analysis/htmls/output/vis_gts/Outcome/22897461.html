Effect of rosuvastatin monotherapy or in combination with fenofibrate or ω-3 fatty acids on <font color="red">lipoprotein_1</font> <font color="red">subfraction_1</font> <font color="red">profile_1</font> in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Raised triglycerides ( TG ) , decreased high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) levels and a predominance of small dense low density lipoproteins ( sdLDL ) are characteristics of the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of high - dose rosuvastatin monotherapy with moderate dosing combined with fenofibrate or ω-3 fatty acids on the <font color="red">lipoprotein_1</font> <font color="red">subfraction_1</font> <font color="red">profile_1</font> in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and MetS. 
<br> METHODS We previously randomised patients with low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL - C ) > 160 and TG > 200   mg / dl to rosuvastatin monotherapy 40   mg / day ( R group , n = 30 ) or rosuvastatin 10 mg / day combined with fenofibrate 200 mg / day ( RF group , n = 30 ) or ω-3 fatty acids 2 g / day ( Rω group , n = 30 ) . In the present study , only patients with MetS were included ( 24 , 23 and 24 in the R , RF and Rω groups respectively ) . At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment , the <font color="red">lipoprotein_1</font> <font color="red">subfraction_1</font> <font color="red">profile_1</font> was determined by polyacrylamide 3% gel electrophoresis . 
<br> RESULTS The <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">LDL_1</font> <font color="red">size_1</font> was significantly increased in all groups . This change was more prominent with RF than with other treatments in parallel with its greater <font color="red">hypotriglyceridemic_1</font> <font color="red">capacity_1</font> ( p < 0.05 compared with R and Rω ) . A decrease in <font color="red">insulin_1</font> <font color="red">resistance_1</font> by RF was also noted . Only RF significantly raised <font color="red">HDL_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">C_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> ( by 7.7% , p < 0.05 ) by increasing the cholesterol of small HDL particles . The <font color="red">cholesterol_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">larger_1</font> <font color="red">HDL_1</font> <font color="red">subclasses_1</font> was significantly increased by R and Rω. 
<br> CONCLUSIONS All regimens increased mean <font color="red">LDL_1</font> <font color="red">size_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> RF was the most effective . A differential effect of treatments was noted on the HDL subfraction profile .
