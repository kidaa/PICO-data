[ Limbal epithelial autograft transplantation in treatment of pterygium ] . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effects of limbal epithelial autograft transplantation and pterygium excision in the treatment of pterygium . 
<br> METHODS A prospective randomized paired - eye trial was studied . There were 208 patients ( 229 eyes ) with initial pterygium , and they were allocated to two groups : excision of pterygium with limbal epithelial autograft transplantation surgery ( A group , 106 cases and 124 eyes ) and simple pterygium excision ( B group , 102 cases and 105 eyes ) . The criteria for recovery were <font color="red">corneal_1</font> <font color="red">transparency_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">stable_1</font> <font color="red">epithelial_1</font> <font color="red">healing_1</font> and no <font color="red">abnormal_1</font> <font color="red">proliferation_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">pterygium_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">like_1</font> <font color="red">tissue_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The post - operative follow - up periods ranged from 18 approximately 28 ( 22.4 + /- 4.9 ) months . 
<br> RESULTS Some of the patients lost follow - up . In the eyes followed up , 5 of 11 2 eyes ( 4.5% ) in A group and 41 of 96 eyes ( 42.7% ) in B group were <font color="red">recurred_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the difference being very significant ( P < 0.001 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION To provide a new stem cell source , limbal epithelial autograft transplantation , for an injured limb us is a reasonable therapeutic method for the treatment of pterygium .
