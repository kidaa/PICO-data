Gastric dysrhythmia in infants with gastrointestinal diseases measured by <font color="red">epigastric_1</font> <font color="red">impedance_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia , where different types of <font color="red">gastric_1</font> <font color="red">electrical_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> have been described . These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes . <font color="red">Epigastric_1</font> <font color="red">impedance_1</font> is a non - invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity . At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia , measured with <font color="red">epigastric_1</font> <font color="red">impedance_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> has been presented , and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of <font color="red">impedance_1</font> <font color="red">gastrography_1</font> in control infants , compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases , before and after treatment of their disease . 
<br> METHOD 21 patients ( age 0 - 2 months ) and 40 healthy infants ( age 0 - 2 months ) were investigated . The patients suffered from partial or total intestinal obstruction , necrotizing enterocolitis or pyloric stenosis . All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour . The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible . 
<br> RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients . A <font color="red">persistent_2</font> <font color="red">phasic_2</font> <font color="red">activity_2</font> <font color="red">pattern_2</font> was found in 19 of the 21 patients , <font color="red">high_2</font> <font color="red">frequency_2</font> <font color="red">phasic_2</font> <font color="red">activity_2</font> in 11 of the 21 patients . <font color="red">Short_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">term_2</font> <font color="red">phasic_2</font> <font color="red">activity_2</font> was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants ( 32.5% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Using <font color="red">epigastric_1</font> <font color="red">impedance_1</font> we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity , which was not found in the control infants . The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown , but they may be related to electrical control activity .
