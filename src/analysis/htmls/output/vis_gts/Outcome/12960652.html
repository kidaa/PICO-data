Gastric dysrhythmia in infants with gastrointestinal diseases measured by epigastric impedance . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia , where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described . These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes . Epigastric impedance is a non - invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and <font color="red">gastric_1</font> <font color="red">phasic_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> At present no study of <font color="red">gastric_1</font> <font color="red">dysrhythmia_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> measured with epigastric impedance , has been presented , and the purpose of the present study was to investigate <font color="red">gastric_1</font> <font color="red">rhythms_1</font> by means of impedance gastrography in control infants , compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases , before and after treatment of their disease . 
<br> METHOD 21 patients ( age 0 - 2 months ) and 40 healthy infants ( age 0 - 2 months ) were investigated . The patients suffered from <font color="red">partial_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">intestinal_1</font> <font color="red">obstruction_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">necrotizing_1</font> <font color="red">enterocolitis_1</font> or <font color="red">pyloric_1</font> <font color="red">stenosis_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour . The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible . 
<br> RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients . A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients , high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients . Short - term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants ( 32.5% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Using epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had <font color="red">gastric_1</font> <font color="red">phasic_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> which was not found in the control infants . The origin of the <font color="red">gastric_1</font> <font color="red">phasic_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> <font color="red">patterns_1</font> is unknown , but they may be related to electrical control activity .
