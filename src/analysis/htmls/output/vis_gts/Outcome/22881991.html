Teaching <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> to young children with autism : a randomised controlled trial of an emotion training programme . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Children with autism have difficulties in <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">recognition_1</font> and a number of interventions have been designed to target these problems . However , few <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> interventions have been trialled with young children with autism and co - morbid ID . This study aimed to evaluate the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of an <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> programme for a group of young children with autism with a range of intellectual ability . 
<br> METHODS Participants were 55 children with autistic disorder , aged 4 - 7 years ( FSIQ 42 - 107 ) . Children were randomly assigned to an intervention ( n = 28 ) or control group ( n = 27 ) . Participants in the intervention group watched a DVD designed to teach <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> to children with autism ( the Transporters ) , whereas the control group watched a DVD of Thomas the Tank Engine . Participants were assessed on their ability to complete <font color="red">basic_1</font> <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">tasks_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">mindreading_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">theory_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">mind_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">TOM_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">tasks_1</font> before and after the 4-week intervention period , and at 3-month follow - up . 
<br> RESULTS Analyses controlled for the effect of chronological age , verbal intelligence , gender and DVD viewing time on outcomes . Children in the intervention group showed improved performance in the <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">anger_1</font> compared with the control group , with few improvements maintained at 3-month follow - up . There was no generalisation of skills to <font color="red">TOM_1</font> or <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The Transporters programme showed limited <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> in teaching <font color="red">basic_1</font> <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> to young children with autism with a lower range of cognitive ability . Improvements were limited to the <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">expressions_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">anger_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> with poor maintenance of these skills at follow - up . These findings provide limited support for the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of the Transporters programme for young children with autism of a lower cognitive range .
