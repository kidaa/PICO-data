Superior <font color="red">visual_1</font> <font color="red">search_1</font> in adults with autism . 
<br>
<br> Recent studies have suggested that children with autism perform better than matched controls on visual search tasks and that this stems from a superior <font color="red">visual_1</font> <font color="red">discrimination_1</font> <font color="red">ability_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> This study assessed whether these findings generalize from children to adults with autism . Experiments 1 and 2 showed that , like children , adults with autism were superior to controls at <font color="red">searching_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">targets_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Experiment 3 showed that increases in target - distractor similarity slowed the <font color="red">visual_1</font> <font color="red">search_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> of the control group significantly more than that of the autism group , suggesting that the adults with autism have a superior <font color="red">visual_1</font> <font color="red">discrimination_1</font> <font color="red">ability_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Thus , these experiments replicate in adults previous findings in children with autism . Superior <font color="red">unique_1</font> <font color="red">item_1</font> <font color="red">detection_1</font> in adults with autism , stemming from enhanced discrimination , is discussed in the light of the possible role of stimulus processing disturbances in the disorder in general .
