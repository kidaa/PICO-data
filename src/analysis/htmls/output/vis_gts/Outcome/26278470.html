Inference - Based Approach versus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder with Poor Insight : A 24-Session Randomized Controlled Trial . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE Obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) with poor insight has severe consequences for patients ; nonetheless , no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the <font color="red">effectiveness_1</font> of any treatment specifically for poor - insight OCD . A new psychotherapy for OCD , the inference - based approach ( IBA ) , targets insight in OCD by strengthening normal sensory - driven reality testing . The goal of the present study is to compare the <font color="red">effectiveness_1</font> of this new treatment to the <font color="red">effectiveness_1</font> of cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) for patients with OCD with poor insight . 
<br> METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted , in which 90 patients with OCD with poor insight received either 24 CBT sessions or 24 IBA sessions . The primary outcome measure was the <font color="red">Yale_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Brown_1</font> <font color="red">Obsessive_1</font> <font color="red">Compulsive_1</font> <font color="red">Scale_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">YBOCS_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Secondary outcome measures were <font color="red">level_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">insight_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">depressive_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Mixed - effects models were used to determine the treatment effect . 
<br> RESULTS In both conditions , a significant <font color="red">OCD_1</font> <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">reduction_1</font> was reached , but no condition effects were established . Post hoc , in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight ( n = 23 ) , it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher <font color="red">OCD_1</font> <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">reduction_1</font> than the patients treated with CBT [ estimated marginal mean = -7.77 , t(219.45 ) = -2.4 , p = 0.017 ] . 
<br> CONCLUSION Patients with OCD with poor insight improve significantly after psychological treatment . The results of this study suggest that both CBT and the IBA are effective treatments for OCD with poor insight . The IBA might be more promising than CBT for patients with more extreme poor insight .
