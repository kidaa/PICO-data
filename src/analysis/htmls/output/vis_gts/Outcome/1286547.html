Reduced <font color="red">platelet_1</font> <font color="red">thromboxane_1</font> <font color="red">formation_1</font> after long - term administration of a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker : a prospective , double - blind , placebo - controlled study with nitrendipine in borderline hypertensive patients with IDDM - type diabetes mellitus . 
<br>
<br> Twenty - nine IDDM patients with borderline hypertension were randomly allocated to placebo or nitrendipine treatment . Nitrendipine was given orally at a dosage of 20 mg once daily over 4 weeks . <font color="red">Stimulated_1</font> <font color="red">platelet_1</font> <font color="red">thromboxane_1</font> <font color="red">formation_1</font> at rest and after standardized , non exhausting exercise was measured by standard methods . In addition , <font color="red">plasma_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">platelet_1</font> <font color="red">factor_1</font> <font color="red">4_1</font> and <font color="red">aggregation_1</font> <font color="red">responses_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">collagen_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">ADP_1</font> were determined . In the treatment group <font color="red">thromboxane_1</font> <font color="red">formation_1</font> after stimulation with collagen ( 0.3 and 1.0 micrograms / ml ) and 1 mM arachidonic acid ( AA ) was reduced in the resting state . Exercise induced <font color="red">change_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">thromboxane_1</font> <font color="red">synthesis_1</font> in response to 1.0 micrograms / ml collagen was significantly lower as compared to placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . In parallel , <font color="red">PF4_1</font> <font color="red">plasma_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> were significantly lowered ( p < 0.05 ) . <font color="red">Whole_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">aggregation_1</font> <font color="red">after_1</font> <font color="red">collagen_1</font> <font color="red">stimulation_1</font> ( 1.0 micrograms / ml ) was reduced after 4 weeks of nitrendipine treatment , but <font color="red">ADP_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">5_1</font> <font color="red">microM_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">induced_1</font> <font color="red">aggregation_1</font> was not . These effects of nitrendipine were not seen in platelet rich plasma . In conclusion long - term nitrendipine treatment may inhibit <font color="red">collagen_1</font> <font color="red">dependent_1</font> <font color="red">platelet_1</font> <font color="red">activation_1</font> in the blood of diabetic patients with borderline hypertension .
