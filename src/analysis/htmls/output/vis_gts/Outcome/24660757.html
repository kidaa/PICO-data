<font color="red">Compensation_1</font> in intergroup relations : an investigation of its structural and strategic foundations . 
<br>
<br> Recent work in intergroup relations stresses the role of two fundamental dimensions , competence and warmth , which organize the perception of social groups . A pattern often encountered in people 's ratings is one of compensation in that a group that is evaluated higher than another group on one of the two fundamental dimensions is also judged lower on the other fundamental dimension . Based on Social Identity Theory , the present work extends previous research on compensation by examining boundary conditions as well as underlying psychological processes . Two studies involving experimental and correlational evidence , minimal and real groups , and different kinds of conflict , reveal that <font color="red">compensation_1</font> is more likely when the groups are in asymmetrical relation and share a cooperative view of the intergroup setting . Our data also suggest that , among members of low status groups , <font color="red">compensation_1</font> is associated with social creativity . In contrast , and in line with the ' noblesse oblige ' effect , members of the high status group would seem to rely on <font color="red">compensation_1</font> as a means to appear non - discriminatory .
