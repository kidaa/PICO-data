<br> Children acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things , but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired . In this article , it is <font color="red">proposed_1</font> that children <font color="red">acquire_1</font> <font color="red">generic_1</font> <font color="red">knowledge_1</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">sharing_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">pretend_1</font> <font color="red">play_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In Experiment 1 , twenty - two 3- to 4-year - olds watched pretense in which a puppet represented a " nerp " ( an unfamiliar kind of animal ) .
