Clinical performance of the Reichert AT550 : a new non - contact tonometer . 
<br>
<br> The aim of the present study was to assess the <font color="red">level_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">accuracy_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">measurements_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">intra_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">ocular_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">IOP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> obtained with a new non - contact tonometer ( NCT ) the Reichert AT550 . Measurements were compared against those obtained with the Reichert Xpert Plus , Goldmann applanation tonometer and Perkins tonometer . Thirty - five university students were assessed with the four tonometers in a randomised order , with non - contact tonometry performed first . Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer . Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained . No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the AT550 NCT with contact applanation tonometry ( AT ) ( p > 0.05 ) , displaying the closest level of agreement ( as represented by the <font color="red">lowest_1</font> <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">difference_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">narrowest_1</font> <font color="red">confidence_1</font> <font color="red">interval_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> with the Goldmann tonometer ( limits of agreement , 0.12+/-2.17 ) . In conclusion , <font color="red">readings_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">IOP_1</font> with the AT550 NCT are clinically comparable with those obtained with Goldmann tonometry in a population with IOP within the normal range .
