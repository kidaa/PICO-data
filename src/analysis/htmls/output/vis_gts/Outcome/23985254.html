[ Impact of CCND1 A870 G polymorphism on <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> in postoperative rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy ] . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) of CCND1 A870 G and <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">AEs_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> in postoperative rectal cancer patients who received capecitabine - based postoperative chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) . 
<br> METHODS Four hundred patients with stage II and III rectal cancer received postoperative CRT of capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin were accumulated and prostectively studied in this study . The patients were randomly divided into two groups . Two hundred and twenty - eight patients were treated with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy ( Cap - CRT ) , and 172 patients were treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin plus radiotherapy ( Cap - Oxa - CRT ) . <font color="red">Adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> were graded according to the <font color="red">Common_1</font> <font color="red">Terminology_1</font> <font color="red">Criteria_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">Adverse_1</font> <font color="red">Events_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">v._1</font> <font color="red">3.0_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CTCAE_1</font> <font color="red">v3.0_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The genotype of CCND1 A870 G in the patients was detected by polymerase chain reaction - based restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR - RFLP ) analysis . The associations between the SNP and <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">AEs_1</font> were indicated by odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) , which were computed with logistic regression model . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 136 patients presented <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">AEs_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Among them the frequencies of the three genotypes GG , GA and AA were 16.9% , 50.7% and 32.4% , compared with 24.6% , 48.1% and 27.3% , respectively , among the patients without <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">AEs_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Diarrhea_1</font> was the most common <font color="red">AE_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhea_1</font> occurred in 109 patients . The frequencies of the three genotypes GG , GA and AA were 15.6% , 47.7% and 36.7% among these patients , compared with 24.4% , 49.5% and 26.1% , respectively , among patients without <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhea_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a 1.66-fold increased risk for <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhea_1</font> in patients with AA genotype ( 95%CI 1.03 - 2.67 , P = 0.038 ) compared with the cases with GG or GA genotypes . Stratified analysis showed that in the Cap - Oxa - CRT group , patients with AA genotype showed a 2.34-fold increased risk for <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhea_1</font> ( 95%CI 1.16 - 4.76 , P = 0.018 ) compared with those with GG or GA genotypes , but in the Cap - CRT group , the SNP was not associated with the risk of <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhea_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The genetic polymorphism of CCND1 A870 G might be a potential biomarker for predicting <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">AEs_1</font> in postoperative stage II and III rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin .
