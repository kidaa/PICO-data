Phase III study of two different dosing schedules of erythropoietin in anemic patients with cancer . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare maintenance epoetin alfa administered once every 3 weeks with continued weekly epoetin alfa for patients with cancer - associated anemia . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously ( SC ) , followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa ( 40 K arm ) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa ( 120 K arm ) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks . 
<br> RESULTS Three hundred sixty - five patients were enrolled . One hundred eighty - three patients were assigned to the 40 K arm , and 182 were assigned to the 120 K arm . There was no difference in the <font color="red">proportion_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">requiring_1</font> <font color="red">transfusions_1</font> during the study ( 23% in 40 K arm and 18% in 120 K arm , P = .22 ) or specifically during the maintenance phase ( 13% in 40 K arm v 15% in 120 K arm , P = .58 ) . Patients randomly assigned to the 40 K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g / dL <font color="red">hemoglobin_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Hb_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">increment_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> were more likely to have a <font color="red">drug_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">held_1</font> <font color="red">because_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">high_1</font> <font color="red">Hb_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and had higher <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">end_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">Hb_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Toxicities_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> including <font color="red">thromboembolism_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">overall_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> were similar . Patients in the 40 K arm had a higher <font color="red">global_1</font> <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> at baseline for unclear reasons , whereas patients in the 120 K arm had a greater <font color="red">global_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> <font color="red">improvement_1</font> during the study , so <font color="red">end_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> was equivalent . 
<br> CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U , a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing <font color="red">transfusion_1</font> <font color="red">needs_1</font> or sacrificing <font color="red">QOL_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The <font color="red">Hb_1</font> <font color="red">increment_1</font> is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa . Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results .
