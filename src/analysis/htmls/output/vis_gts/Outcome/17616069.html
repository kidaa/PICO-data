[ Intravenous treatment of <font color="red">postpartum_1</font> <font color="red">anemia_1</font> with trivalent ferrum preparation ] . 
<br>
<br> AIM OF THE STUDY To assess the <font color="red">effectivity_1</font> and <font color="red">safeness_1</font> of intravenous treatment of <font color="red">pospartal_1</font> <font color="red">anemia_1</font> with trivalent ferrum preparation . 
<br> TYPE OF THE STUDY Prospective randomized study . 
<br> SETTING Department of Obstetric and Gynecology 2nd Medical Faculty Charles University and Teaching Hospital Motol , Prague , and Department of Obstetric and Gynecology 1st Medical Faculty and Teaching Hospital Bulovka , Prague . 
<br> METHODS 500 mg of sacharose ferric oxide ( Venofer ) was intravenously administered in two days regimen to 50 women with clinical and lab signs of postpartal anemia . The effect of administered drug was determined by comparsion of <font color="red">values_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">red_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">count_1</font> <font color="red">recovered_1</font> before the treatment , 2nd or 3rd day post administration and two weeks later . The <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">values_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">soluble_1</font> <font color="red">transferrin_1</font> <font color="red">receptors_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">ferritin_1</font> were observed as markers of iron cell saturation and body iron reserves , too . Integral part of the study was the monitoring of <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> during the treatment . 
<br> RESULTS Venofer came in sight as effective drug in the treatment of <font color="red">pospartal_1</font> <font color="red">anemia_1</font> and could become as the alternative to blood transfusion in mid - severe cases . It should be emphasized that we have not encountered any <font color="red">serious_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">event_1</font> with intravenous trivalent saccharose ferric oxide treatment .
