<br>
<br> Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause - related treatment of periodontal diseases , repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth . In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy , non - root substance removing curettes have been developed . However , the <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">effects_1</font> of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established . The aims of this study were , therefore , to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic curettes ( Universal Perio Soft Scaler , Hawe - Neos Dental , Bioggio , TI , Switzerland ) versus conventional steel curettes on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy . 40 subjects participated in this parallel , randomized , double blind , prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy . 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel curettes during a supportive periodontal care visit ( SPT ) . The other 20 subjects , the experimental group , were treated using plastic curettes during a similar SPT visit . Clinical parameters , such as <font color="red">bleeding_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">probing_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">BOP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and <font color="red">probing_1</font> <font color="red">pocket_1</font> <font color="red">depth_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">PPD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> were assessed at baseline and 3 - 6 months later at the next regular SPT visit . In addition , the <font color="red">BOP_1</font> <font color="red">percentage_1</font> was determined 10 days following baseline . The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding <font color="red">BOP_1</font> and <font color="red">PPD_1</font> at any observation time . Both treatments were effective in reducing the <font color="red">BOP_1</font> <font color="red">percentage_1</font> which ranged from 17 - 42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days ( <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">BOP_1</font> baseline : 26% , <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">BOP_1</font> after 10 days : 16% ) . This clinical study suggests that non - root substance removing curettes may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care , thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth .
