Youth with autism spectrum disorder comprehend lexicalized and novel primary conceptual metaphors . 
<br>
<br> Individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) have difficulty comprehending metaphors . However , no study to date has examined whether or not they <font color="red">understand_1</font> <font color="red">conceptual_1</font> <font color="red">metaphors_1</font> ( i.e. mappings between conceptual structures ) , which could be the building blocks of metaphoric thinking and understanding . We investigated whether 13 participants with ASD ( age 7;03 - 22;03 ) and 13 age - matched typically developing ( TD ) controls could <font color="red">comprehend_1</font> <font color="red">lexicalized_1</font> <font color="red">conceptual_1</font> <font color="red">metaphors_1</font> ( e.g. , Susan is a warm person ) and <font color="red">novel_1</font> <font color="red">ones_1</font> ( e.g. , Susan is a toasty person ) . Individuals with ASD performed at greater than chance levels on both metaphor types , although their performance was lower than TD participants . We discuss the theoretical relevance of these findings and educational implications .
