<br> BACKGROUND The aim of this study was the examination of <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> and <font color="red">tolerability_1</font> of an application - form of the new combination of Xylometazoline with Dexpanthenol ( Nasic ) versus Xylometazoline alone . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Randomized verum controlled parallel - group - comparison of two weeks treatment of a nasal - spray . 61 inpatients with the diagnosis Rhinitis following nasal operation were included in this study and 30 patients were treated with verum and placebo each . The assessment of <font color="red">nasal_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">breathing_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">resistance_1</font> <font color="red">according_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> was defined as target - parameter . Confirmatory statistical analysis was carried out according to Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney - U two - sided at alpha < or = 0.05 . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The superiority of the combination of Xylometazoline - Dexpanthenol nasal - spray versus Xylometazoline nasal spray could be proven for the target - parameter as clinically relevant and statistically significant . The <font color="red">clinically_1</font> <font color="red">proven_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> is emphasized by good <font color="red">tolerability_1</font> of both treatments . Due to easy handling of the nasal - spray a good <font color="red">compliance_1</font> was confirmed . 
<br> CONCLUSION Distinct improvement of <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> in patients following nasal operations underlines the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of both medications . With respect to the <font color="red">tolerability_1</font> therapy with the combination is more beneficial in comparison to the alternative therapy .
