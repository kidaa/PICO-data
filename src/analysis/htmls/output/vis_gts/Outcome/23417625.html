<br>
<br> High - functioning autism ( HFA ) is characterized by persistent impairment in social interaction despite the absence of mental retardation . Although an increasing number of group - based programs for the improvement of social skills have been described , randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> To compare the effect of a Social Skills Training Group - based Program ( SST - GP ) and a Leisure Activities Group - based Program ( LA - GP ) on the perception of facial emotions and quality of life ( QoL ) in young people with HFA . Eligible patients were children and adolescents with HFA . Participants were randomized to the SST or LA group . The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for <font color="red">facial_1</font> <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">labeling_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">DANVA2_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> from baseline . After the 6-month training period , the SST Group made fewer errors in <font color="red">labeling_1</font> <font color="red">anger_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">faces_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable . Progress in the <font color="red">ability_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">recognize_1</font> <font color="red">anger_1</font> in the SST Group was due to better <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">intensity_1</font> <font color="red">stimuli_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">faces_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">QoL_1</font> increased in the SST Group in the dimension of <font color="red">school_1</font> <font color="red">environment_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community . The SST - GP had higher <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> than the LA - GP . Data justify replication using larger samples .
