<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Public - health guidelines recommend patients with congenital heart disease to exercise . Studies have shown that patients with congenital heart disease can improve physical exercise capacity . The effect of training on regional ventricular performance has hardly been studied . We performed a pilot study to assess whether an exercise training program would result in <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">changes_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">regional_1</font> <font color="red">ventricular_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot . 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS Multicenter prospective randomized controlled pilot study in patients with tetralogy of Fallot aged 10 to 25 years . A 12-week standardized aerobic dynamic exercise training program ( 3 one - hour sessions per week ) was used . <font color="red">Pre-_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">post_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> <font color="red">cardiopulmonary_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> <font color="red">tests_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">MRI_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">echocardiography_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">including_1</font> <font color="red">tissue_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Doppler_1</font> <font color="red">imaging_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> were performed . Patients were randomized to the exercise group ( n=28 ) or control group ( n=20 ) . One patient in the exercise group dropped out . Change in <font color="red">tissue_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Doppler_1</font> <font color="red">imaging_1</font> <font color="red">parameters_1</font> was similar in the exercise group and control group ( change in <font color="red">right_1</font> <font color="red">ventricle_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">wall_1</font> <font color="red">peak_1</font> <font color="red">velocity_1</font> <font color="red">E_1</font> <font color="red">'_1</font> exercise group , 0.8±2.6 cm / s ; control group , 0.9±4.1 ; <font color="red">peak_1</font> <font color="red">velocity_1</font> A ' exercise group , 0.4±2.4 m / s ; control group 4.6±18.1 cm / s ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS This randomized controlled pilot study provides preliminary data suggesting that regional ventricular performance is well <font color="red">maintained_1</font> during 3-month aerobic dynamic exercise training in children and young adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot . This information might help patients adhere to current public - health guidelines .
