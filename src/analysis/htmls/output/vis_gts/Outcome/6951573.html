<br>
<br> One hundred and twenty patients presenting at Macquarie Hospital for admission were randomly allocated into two groups . The control group patients received standard hospital care and follow - up . The project group patients were not admitted if this could be avoided ; instead they were taken back to the community by the project team who provided them and their relatives with comprehensive , assertive and prolonged follow - up treatment backed by a 24-hour crisis service . The majority ( 63% ) of the project group had no admission during the 10 month study period . Initially , the <font color="red">burden_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">relatives_1</font> of the project group was higher , but by one month it was somewhat lower and by four months it was significantly lower than the burden on the control group relatives . Relatives of the project group patients were significantly more <font color="red">satisfied_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> than control group relatives . It is clearly <font color="red">feasible_1</font> to treat most psychiatric patients in the community without increasing the <font color="red">burden_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">their_1</font> <font color="red">relatives_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
