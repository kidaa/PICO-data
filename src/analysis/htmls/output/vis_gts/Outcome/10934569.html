<br> Young children with pervasive developmental disorder were randomly assigned to intensive treatment or parent training . The intensive treatment group ( 7 with autism , 8 with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified -- NOS ) averaged 24.52 hours per week of individual treatment for one year , gradually reducing hours over the next 1 to 2 years . The parent training group ( 7 with autism , 6 with pervasive developmental disorder NOS ) received 3 to 9 months of parent training .
