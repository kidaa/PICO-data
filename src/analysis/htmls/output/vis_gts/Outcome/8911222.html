Effects of tryptophan depletion in drug - free adults with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the <font color="red">behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">biochemical_1</font> <font color="red">responses_1</font> to acute tryptophan depletion in drug - free adult patients with autistic disorder . 
<br> METHODS Twenty drug - free adults with autistic disorder ( 16 men and 4 women ) ( mean [ + /- SD ] age , 30.5 + /- 8.5 years ) underwent short - term tryptophan depletion in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized crossover design . Patients received a 24-hour , low - tryptophan diet followed the next morning by an amino acid drink . <font color="red">Behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">ratings_1</font> were obtained on the morning of the amino acid drink ( baseline ) and 180 , 300 , and 420 minutes after the drink . <font color="red">Plasma_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink . The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days . 
<br> RESULTS Eleven ( 65% ) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of <font color="red">behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> with short - term tryptophan depletion , but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">status_1</font> from baseline after sham depletion ( P = .001 ) . Tryptophan depletion led to a significant increase in <font color="red">behaviors_1</font> <font color="red">such_1</font> <font color="red">as_1</font> <font color="red">whirling_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">flapping_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">pacing_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">banging_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">hitting_1</font> <font color="red">self_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">rocking_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">toe_1</font> <font color="red">walking_1</font> ( P < .05 ) . In addition , patients were significantly less <font color="red">calm_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">happy_1</font> and more <font color="red">anxious_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> No significant change was observed in <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">relatedness_1</font> or <font color="red">repetitive_1</font> <font color="red">thoughts_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">behavior_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Plasma_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> were reduced 86% and 69% , respectively , 5 hours after the tryptophan - deficient amino acid drink . Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline <font color="red">plasma_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> ( P < .001 ) and <font color="red">Autism_1</font> <font color="red">Behavior_1</font> <font color="red">Checklist_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> ( P = .005 ) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after tryptophan depletion . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism . These data suggest that the short - term reduction of serotonin precursor availability may exacerbate some <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> <font color="red">characteristic_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">autism_1</font> in some patients . Continued investigation into the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis and treatment of autistic disorder is warranted .
