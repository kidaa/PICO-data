Among the 273 children who were seen and weighed at the one - year follow - up visit , the <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">weight_1</font> <font color="red">gain_1</font> was 8 per cent greater for those receiving levamisole than for placebo - treated controls ( p = .06 ) . In 78 children known to be infected with Ascaris at baseline , the <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">weight_1</font> <font color="red">gain_1</font> was 21 per cent greater in children treated with levamisole than in those receiving placebo ( p = .03 ) . The <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">height_1</font> <font color="red">gain_1</font> was no different for treatment and placebo groups .
