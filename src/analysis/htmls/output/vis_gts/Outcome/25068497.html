<font color="red">Safety_1</font> and <font color="red">preliminary_1</font> <font color="red">immunogenicity_1</font> of Cuban pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in healthy children : a randomized phase I clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> A new heptavalent conjugate vaccine ( PCV7-TT ) is under development in Cuba . PCV7-TT contains 2 μg of serotypes 1 , 5 , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F and 4 μg of 6B , each one conjugated to tetanus toxoid ( TT ) . This vaccine was designed with the serotypes that cause most invasive pneumococcal diseases ( IPD ) worldwide . In the present study , we investigated the <font color="red">safety_1</font> and explored the <font color="red">immunogenicity_1</font> of PCV7-TT during a controlled , randomized and double blind clinical trial phase I in 4 - 5-year - old children . PCV7-TT was well <font color="red">tolerated_1</font> and as safe as Synflorix used as control vaccine . Following a single - dose vaccination , all individual serotypes included in PCV7-TT induced statistically significant increase of <font color="red">IgG_1</font> <font color="red">GMC_1</font> and <font color="red">OPA_1</font> <font color="red">GMT_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> These are the first clinical results of PCV7-TT in children and they pave the way toward next clinical trials in children and infants . This clinical trial was published in the Cuban Public Register of Clinical Trials with code RPCEC00000173 .
