Rapid tightening of blood glucose control leads to transient <font color="red">deterioration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">retinopathy_1</font> in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus : the Oslo study . 
<br>
<br> In a study of retinopathy during one year of tight blood glucose control 45 type I ( insulin dependent ) diabetics without proliferative retinopathy were randomised to receive either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion , multiple insulin injections , or conventional insulin treatment ( controls ) . Near normoglycaemia was achieved with continuous infusion and multiple injections but not with conventional treatment . Blind evaluation of fluorescein angiograms performed three monthly showed <font color="red">progression_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">retinopathy_1</font> in the control group , transient deterioration in the continuous infusion group , and no change in the multiple injection group . Half the patients receiving continuous infusion and multiple injections developed <font color="red">retinal_1</font> <font color="red">cotton_1</font> <font color="red">wool_1</font> <font color="red">spots_1</font> after three to six months . These changes regressed in all but four patients after 12 months . Control patients did not develop <font color="red">cotton_1</font> <font color="red">wool_1</font> <font color="red">spots_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Patients who developed <font color="red">cotton_1</font> <font color="red">wool_1</font> <font color="red">spots_1</font> are characterised by a larger decrement in glycosylated haemoglobin and blood glucose values , more frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia , a longer duration of diabetes , and more severe retinopathy at onset . A large and rapid fall in blood glucose concentration may promote transient <font color="red">deterioration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">diabetic_1</font> <font color="red">retinopathy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
