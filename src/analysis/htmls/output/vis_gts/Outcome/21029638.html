<br> OBJECTIVE To explore the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of paliperidone extended - release tablets in the improvement of <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">functions_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">schizophrenics_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS A total of 81 schizophrenics were randomly divided into study group with paliperidone extended - release tablets and control group with risperidone for a 12-week treatment . They were assessed and analyzed by <font color="red">positive_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">negative_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> <font color="red">scales_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">PANSS_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">disability_1</font> <font color="red">screening_1</font> <font color="red">schedule_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">SDSS_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">emergent_1</font> <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">scale_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">TESS_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> at baseline , 6(th ) weekend and 12(th ) weekend . 
<br> RESULTS In study group , the factors and total scores of <font color="red">PANSS_1</font> in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 12.0 ± 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ± 3.6 ) , ( 26.2 ± 5.0 ) , ( 50.2 ± 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those at baseline [ ( 24.7 ± 5.3 ) , ( 23.8 ± 3.6 ) , ( 45.0 ± 2.9 ) , ( 93.5 ± 6.8 ) ] ( t = 9.60 - 16.78 , P < 0.05 ) . In study group , the positive factor , negative factor and total scores of <font color="red">PANSS_1</font> in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 12.0 ± 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ± 3.6 ) , ( 50.2 ± 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those in the 6(th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 14.2 ± 1.8 ) , ( 14.6 ± 2.4 ) , ( 56.5 ± 6.4 ) ] ( t = 2.58 - 4.26 , P < 0.05 ) . In the 12(th ) weekend of treatment , the factors and total scores of <font color="red">PANSS_1</font> in study group [ ( 12.0 ± 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ± 3.6 ) , ( 26.2 ± 5.0 ) , ( 50.2 ± 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those in control group [ ( 16.9 ± 4.9 ) , ( 18.7 ± 5.3 ) , ( 32.5 ± 5.1 ) , ( 68.1 ± 13.0 ) ] ( t = -4.28 - -5.67 , P < 0.05 ) . In study group , the total scores of <font color="red">SDSS_1</font> in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment ( 5.93 ± 2.78 ) were significantly lower than those at baseline ( 13.9 ± 3.4 ) ( t = 10.83 , P < 0.05 ) . In study group , the total scores of <font color="red">SDSS_1</font> in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment ( 5.9 ± 2.8 ) were significantly lower than those in the 6(th ) weekend of treatment ( 7.6 ± 2.9 ) ( t = 5.21 , P < 0.05 ) . But there was no significant improvement in control group ( t = 1.88 , P > 0.05 ) . In the 12(th ) weekend of treatment , the total scores of <font color="red">SDSS_1</font> in study group ( 5.9 ± 2.8 ) were significantly lower than those in control group ( 8.8 ± 2.9 ) ( t = -4.49 , P < 0.05 ) . No <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">effect_1</font> was reported in either group . 
<br> CONCLUSION Paliperidone extended - release tablets are effective to improve <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">functions_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">psychiatric_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">schizophrenics_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
