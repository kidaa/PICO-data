<br> BACKGROUND A large body of evidence suggests that fine particulate matter ( PM ) air pollution is a cause of cardiovascular disease , but little is known in particular about the cardiovascular effects of indoor air pollution from household use of solid fuels in developing countries . RESPIRE ( Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects ) was a randomized trial of a chimney woodstove that reduces wood smoke exposure . 
<br> OBJECTIVES We tested the hypotheses that the stove intervention , compared with open fire use , would reduce <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">segment_1</font> <font color="red">depression_1</font> and increase <font color="red">heart_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">variability_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">HRV_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS We used two complementary study designs : a ) between - groups comparisons based on randomized stove assignment , and b ) before - and - after comparisons within control subjects who used open fires during the trial and received chimney stoves after the trial . Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among 49 intervention and 70 control women 38 - 84 years of age , and 55 control subjects were also assessed after receiving stoves . <font color="red">HRV_1</font> and <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">segment_1</font> values were assessed for each 30-min period . <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">segment_1</font> <font color="red">depression_1</font> was defined as an average value below -1.00 mm . <font color="red">Personal_1</font> <font color="red">fine_1</font> <font color="red">PM_1</font> [ aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm ( PM₂.₅ ] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">PM₂.₅_1</font> <font color="red">exposure_1</font> means were 266 and 102 μg / m³ during the trial period in the control and intervention groups , respectively . During the trial , the stove intervention was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.08 - 0.90 ) for <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">segment_1</font> <font color="red">depression_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> We found similar associations with the before - and - after comparison . The intervention was not significantly associated with <font color="red">HRV_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The stove intervention was associated with reduced <font color="red">occurrence_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">nonspecific_1</font> <font color="red">ST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">segment_1</font> <font color="red">depression_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> suggesting that household wood smoke exposures affect ventricular repolarization and potentially cardiovascular health .
