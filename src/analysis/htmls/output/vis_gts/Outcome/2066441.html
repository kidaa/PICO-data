Therapeutic effects of combined treatment using tetracycline - immobilized collagen film and root planing in periodontal furcation pockets . 
<br>
<br> 46 upper and lower molars with furcation grade II involvement were selected from 16 patients with periodontal disease . The teeth were randomly allocated to the following groups according to treatment ; ( 1 ) 4 consecutive administrations of tetracycline - immobilized cross - linked collagen film ( TC film ) at intervals of 1 week ( TC group ) ; ( 2 ) 1 root planing treatment ( RP group ) ; ( 3 ) combination treatment ( TC + RP group ) ; ( 4 ) no treatment ( control group ) . The therapeutic effects of each treatment were compared both clinically and microbiologically .

The results showed marked decreases in <font color="red">probing_1</font> <font color="red">depth_1</font> and <font color="red">density_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">micro_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">organisms_1</font> in both the RP and TC + RP groups . In particular , the TC + RP group was characterized by a decreased <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">bleeding_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">pocket_1</font> <font color="red">probing_1</font> and an increased <font color="red">probing_1</font> <font color="red">attachment_1</font> <font color="red">gain_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The above findings demonstrated that root planning is effective in the treatment of furcation involvement and that the effects are enhanced by the local administration of TC films .
