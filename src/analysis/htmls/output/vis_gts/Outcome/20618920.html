<br>
<br> BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure , physical activity , sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of depression . However , to our knowledge , there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy .

Eighty depressed patients undergoing standard antidepressant treatment will be advised to follow four additional hygienic - dietary recommendations about exercise , diet , sunlight exposure and sleep . Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the 6 month intervention period . 
<br> DISCUSSION We expect the patients in the active recommendations group to experience a greater improvement in their <font color="red">depressive_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> If so , this would be a great support for doctors who might systematically recommend these simple and costless measures , especially in primary care .
