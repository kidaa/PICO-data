In school - aged children a combination of galacto - oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus GG increases bifidobacteria more than Lactobacillus GG on its own . 
<br>
<br> The aim of this study was to compare a combination of Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) and galacto - oligosaccharides ( GOS ) with LGG on its own , and their effects on the intestinal microbiota in school - aged children . The randomized , double - blinded , crossover study comprised 30 healthy children . There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash - out period in between . The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk - based fruit juice containing either LGG alone ( 6.5 x 10(9 ) CFU ) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS . <font color="red">Symptom_1</font> <font color="red">diaries_1</font> were filled during the study periods . Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods . At the end of both study periods , the <font color="red">amount_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">bifidobacteria_1</font> was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone ( geometric mean 9.33 x 10(9 ) vs. 4.28 x 10(9 ) CFU / g , p < 0.001 ) . No significant differences were seen in the <font color="red">amount_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">lactobacilli_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">LGG_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> nor did <font color="red">gastrointestinal_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">defecation_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">consistency_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">stools_1</font> or <font color="red">ease_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">defecation_1</font> differ between the two study periods . Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the <font color="red">bifidobacteria_1</font> more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a prebiotic effect in children . The children tolerated well a daily intake of 2 g of GOS .
