Effects of individualized breast cancer risk counseling : a randomized trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Studies have shown that a majority of women with a family history of breast cancer have exaggerated <font color="red">perceptions_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">their_1</font> <font color="red">own_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> of this disease and experience <font color="red">excessive_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In response to the need to communicate more accurate risk information to these women , specialized programs for breast cancer risk counseling have been initiated in medical centers across the United States . 
<br> PURPOSE Our purpose was 1 ) to evaluate the impact of a standardized protocol for individualized breast cancer risk counseling on <font color="red">comprehension_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">personal_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> among first - degree relatives of index breast cancer patients and 2 ) to identify women most and least likely to benefit from such counseling . 
<br> METHODS This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing individualized breast cancer risk counseling to general health counseling ( control ) . We studied 200 women aged 35 years and older who had a family history of breast cancer in a first - degree relative . Women with a personal history of cancer were excluded . <font color="red">Risk_2</font> <font color="red">comprehension_2</font> was assessed as the concordance between perceived " subjective " lifetime <font color="red">breast_1</font> <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> and estimated " objective " lifetime risk . 
<br> RESULTS The results of logistic regression analysis showed that women who received risk counseling were <font color="red">significantly_1</font> <font color="red">more_1</font> <font color="red">likely_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">improve_1</font> <font color="red">their_1</font> <font color="red">risk_3</font> <font color="red">comprehension_3</font> <font color="red">,_3</font> compared with women in the control condition ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.5 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.3 - 9.5 ; P = .01 ) . However , in both groups , about <font color="red">two_1</font> <font color="red">thirds_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">women_1</font> <font color="red">continued_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">overestimate_1</font> <font color="red">their_1</font> <font color="red">lifetime_2</font> <font color="red">risks_2</font> substantially following counseling . Examination of subjects by treatment interaction effects indicated that <font color="red">risk_1</font> <font color="red">counseling_1</font> <font color="red">did_1</font> <font color="red">not_1</font> <font color="red">produce_1</font> <font color="red">improved_2</font> <font color="red">comprehension_2</font> among the large proportion of women who had high levels of anxious preoccupation with breast cancer at base line ( P = .02 ) . In addition , white women were <font color="red">less_1</font> <font color="red">likely_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">benefit_1</font> than African - American women ( OR = 0.34 ; 95% CI = 0.11 - 0.99 ; P = .05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Efforts to counsel women about their breast cancer risks are not likely to be effective unless their <font color="red">breast_1</font> <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">anxieties_1</font> are also addressed . 
<br> IMPLICATIONS Attention to the psychological aspects of breast cancer risk will be critical in the development of risk - counseling programs that incorporate testing for the recently cloned breast cancer susceptibility gene , BRCA1 ( and BRCA2 when that gene has also been cloned ) .
