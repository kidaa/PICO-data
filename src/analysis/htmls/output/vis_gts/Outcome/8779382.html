The effect of tunnelling on <font color="red">epidural_1</font> <font color="red">catheter_1</font> <font color="red">migration_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> A prospective , randomised study of 82 patients having postoperative epidural analgesia was performed to determine whether the tunnelling of an epidural catheter influences its <font color="red">migration_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Tunnelling of the catheter subcutaneously for a distance of 5 cm reduced the <font color="red">incidence_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">inward_1</font> <font color="red">migration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">1_1</font> <font color="red">cm_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">more_1</font> ( p < 0.01 ) compared to a standard method of fixation with a transparent adhesive dressing . This effect was more marked if the epidural catheter was sited in the thoracic rather than the lumbar area . Sixty two percent ( n = 26 ) of tunnelled catheters remained within 0.5 cm of their original position compared to 38% ( n = 16 ) of non - tunnelled catheters , although this difference was not statistically significant . <font color="red">Outward_1</font> <font color="red">catheter_1</font> <font color="red">migration_1</font> was not reduced by subcutaneous tunnelling .
