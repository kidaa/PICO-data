<font color="red">Adherence_1</font> to lifestyle recommendations by patients with depression . 
<br>
<br> INTRODUCTION There is an increasing amount of evidence showing that physical activity and sun exposure are effective coadjuvant treatments for patients with mild to moderate depression . However , there is a lack of information regarding patient 's <font color="red">adherence_1</font> to these recommendations in daily clinical practice . 
<br> METHODS We conducted a study including 15 depressive patients who had been under antidepressant treatment for at least one month . They wore a wrist - watch - like actimetry sensor to measure <font color="red">physical_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> and <font color="red">sun_1</font> <font color="red">exposure_1</font> 24 hours a day . After one week of baseline assessment , patients were randomised into one of the two arms of the study . Patients in the experimental group received a brief note in which they were explicitly asked to increase both their <font color="red">physical_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> <font color="red">level_1</font> and <font color="red">time_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">sun_1</font> <font color="red">exposure_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> while control group patients did not receive these explicit recommendations . 
<br> RESULTS One week after recommendations were delivered , only patients in the experimental group had increased <font color="red">time_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">sun_1</font> <font color="red">exposure_1</font> and <font color="red">physical_1</font> <font color="red">activity_1</font> ( 25.8% and 14.3% , respectively ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Depressive patients are able to follow prescribed lifestyle recommendations in the short - term .
