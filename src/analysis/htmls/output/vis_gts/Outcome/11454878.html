Recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma : a randomized phase III study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus topotecan . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> and <font color="red">safety_1</font> of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) and topotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or did n't respond to first - line , platinum - based chemotherapy . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg / m(2 ) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg / m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks . Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated ( 239 PLD and 235 topotecan ) . They comprised the intent - to - treat population . The overall <font color="red">progression_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> <font color="red">rates_1</font> were similar between the two arms ( P = .095 ) . The overall <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">rates_1</font> for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0% , respectively ( P = .390 ) . Median overall <font color="red">survival_1</font> <font color="red">times_1</font> were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan . Data analyzed in platinum - sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for <font color="red">progression_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> ( P = .037 ) , with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan . For <font color="red">overall_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> PLD was significantly superior to topotecan ( P = .008 ) , with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks . The platinum - refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan ( P = .455 ) . <font color="red">Severe_1</font> <font color="red">hematologic_1</font> <font color="red">toxicity_1</font> was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification , or growth factor or blood product utilization . 
<br> CONCLUSION The comparable <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> favorable <font color="red">safety_1</font> profile , and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population .
