Parent - implemented enhanced milieu teaching with preschool children who have intellectual disabilities . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of enhanced milieu teaching ( EMT ) implemented by parents and therapists versus therapists only on the <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> of preschool children with intellectual disabilities ( IDs ) , including children with Down syndrome and children with autism spectrum disorders . 
<br> METHOD Seventy - seven children were randomly assigned to 2 treatments ( parent + therapist EMT or therapist - only EMT ) and received 36 intervention sessions . Children were assessed before , immediately after , 6 months after , and 12 months after intervention . Separate linear regressions were conducted for each standardized and observational measure at each time point . 
<br> RESULTS Parents in the parent + therapist group demonstrated greater use of <font color="red">EMT_1</font> <font color="red">strategies_1</font> at home than untrained parents in the therapist - only group , and these effects maintained over time . Effect sizes for observational measures ranged from d = 0.10 to d = 1.32 favoring the parent + therapist group , with the largest effect sizes found 12 months after intervention . 
<br> CONCLUSION Findings from this study indicate generally that there are benefits to training parents to implement naturalistic language intervention strategies with preschool children who have ID and significant language impairments .
