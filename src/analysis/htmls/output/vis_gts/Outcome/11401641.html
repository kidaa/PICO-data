Additive <font color="red">IOP_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">reducing_1</font> <font color="red">effect_1</font> of latanoprost in patients insufficiently controlled on timolol . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To evaluate the effect on <font color="red">intraocular_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">IOP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> of switching from timolol to latanoprost or adding latanoprost to timolol in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension where IOP is not adequately controlled with timolol . 
<br> METHODS This was a 6-week , double - masked , randomised multi - centre study . 53 patients with primary open angle glaucoma , capsular glaucoma , or ocular hypertension with an IOP of at least 21 mmHg on current therapy were recruited . After a run - in period of at least 2 weeks on timolol , 5 mg / ml twice daily , patients were randomised to one of three groups . One group continued on timolol , one switched from timolol to latanoprost , 50 microg / ml once daily , and a third group received latanoprost in addition to timolol . The efficacy was evaluated by comparing <font color="red">IOP_1</font> at 9 AM at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">IOP_1</font> at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment ( mean + /- SEM ) were 24.2 + /- 0.9 and 23.8 + /- 1.0 mmHg ( n = 16 ) for patients continuing on timolol , 26.3 + /- 1.2 and 19.6 + /- 1.1 mmHg ( n = 17 ) for patients switching to latanoprost , and 23.2 + /- 1.0 and 17.5 + /- 0.8 mmHg ( n = 17 ) for patients with combined treatment . Adding latanoprost to timolol reduced <font color="red">IOP_1</font> with 5.9 + /- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) and switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced <font color="red">IOP_1</font> with 5.0 + /- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) , which caused in each group a significant <font color="red">IOP_1</font> reduction of about 25% . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The effect of latanoprost was additive to that of timolol , and a good effect on <font color="red">IOP_1</font> reduction was also achieved by switching from timolol to latanoprost , suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to combination treatment .
