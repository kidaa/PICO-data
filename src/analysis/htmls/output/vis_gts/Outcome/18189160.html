<font color="red">Feasibility_1</font> of two dose - dense FEC regimens with growth factor support for adjuvant therapy in patients with early breast cancer : results from a randomised study of the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group ( CECOG ) . 
<br>
<br> Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer , but the optimal dose remains unclear . Further improvements can be achieved with dose - dense regimens , but densification of fluorouracil / epirubicin / cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) has proved difficult , with FEC(60 ) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100 ) associated with toxicity . We investigated the <font color="red">feasibility_1</font> of two intermediate dose - dense FEC regimens . Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75 ) or FEC(90 ) , with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle . Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle . The primary efficacy endpoint was the <font color="red">proportion_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">subjects_1</font> <font color="red">receiving_1</font> <font color="red">>_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">=_1</font> <font color="red">85%_1</font> <font color="red">relative_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">intensity_1</font> and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75 ) and FEC(90 ) arms , respectively . Of 147 FEC(75 ) infusions , 4.1% were delayed , while 9.8% of 143 FEC(90 ) infusions were delayed . The most common reasons for delay were <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> and personal / logistical reasons . One dose reduction occurred during the study ( FEC(90 ) ) , related to <font color="red">diarrhoea_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Grade_1</font> <font color="red">3_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">4_1</font> <font color="red">haematological_1</font> <font color="red">toxicities_1</font> were reported in two patients in the FEC(90 ) arm . There were no incidences of <font color="red">febrile_1</font> <font color="red">neutropenia_1</font> during the study . The most common adverse events were increases in <font color="red">liver_1</font> <font color="red">enzymes_1</font> and <font color="red">gastrointestinal_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> no event resulted in discontinuation .

In conclusion , dose - dense FEC(75 ) and FEC(90 ) are <font color="red">feasible_1</font> with pegfilgrastim support . These regimens are associated with a very low risk of <font color="red">Grade_1</font> <font color="red">3_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">4_1</font> <font color="red">toxicity_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
