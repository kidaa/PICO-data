<br> We previously reported results based on the examination of a gluten- and casein - free diet as an intervention for children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as part of the ScanBrit collaboration . Analysis based on grouped results indicated several significant differences between dietary and non - dietary participants across various <font color="red">core_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">peripheral_1</font> <font color="red">areas_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">functioning_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Results also indicated some disparity in individual responses to dietary modification potentially indicative of responder and non - responder differences . Further examination of the behavioural and psychometric data garnered from participants was undertaken , with a view to determining potential factors pertinent to response to dietary intervention . Participants with <font color="red">clinically_1</font> <font color="red">significant_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> <font color="red">indicative_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">inattention_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">hyperactivity_1</font> <font color="red">behaviours_1</font> and who had a significant positive changes to said scores were defined as responders to the dietary intervention . Analyses indicated several factors to be potentially pertinent to a positive response to dietary intervention in terms of symptom presentation . Chronological age was found to be the strongest predictor of response , where those participants aged between 7 and 9 years seemed to derive most benefit from dietary intervention . Further analysis based on the criteria for original study inclusion on the presence of the urine compound , trans - indolyl-3-acryloylglycine may also merit further investigation . These preliminary observations on potential best responder characteristics to a gluten- and casein - free diet for children with autism require independent replication .
