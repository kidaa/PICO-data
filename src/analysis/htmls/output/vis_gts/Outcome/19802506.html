The effect of weight training on <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">mineral_1</font> <font color="red">density_1</font> and <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">turnover_1</font> in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors with bone loss : a 24-month randomized controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> SUMMARY This study examined whether 24 months of weight training exercises enhanced the effectiveness of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D in maintaining or improving <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">mineral_1</font> <font color="red">density_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">BMD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors . Subjects who were > or = 50% adherent to exercise had no improvement in <font color="red">BMD_1</font> but were less likely to lose <font color="red">BMD_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> INTRODUCTION This study examined whether ( 1 ) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors ( BCS ) with bone loss taking 24 months of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D had increased <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">mineral_1</font> <font color="red">density_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">BMD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> at the total hip , femoral neck , L1-L4 spine , total radius and 33% radius , and decreased <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">turnover_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> ( 2 ) subjects who also participated in strength / weight training ( ST ) exercises had greater increases in <font color="red">BMD_1</font> and greater decreases in <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">turnover_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> and ( 3 ) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve ( at least maintain ) <font color="red">BMD_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS Postmenopausal BCS ( 223 ) were randomly assigned to exercise plus medication or medication only groups . Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly , and the exercise group additionally had ST exercises twice weekly . 
<br> RESULTS After 24 months , women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in <font color="red">BMD_1</font> at the total hip ( + 1.81% ) and spine ( + 2.85% ) and significant decreases in <font color="red">Alkphase_1</font> <font color="red">B_1</font> ( -8.7% ) and <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">NTx_1</font> ( -16.7% ) . Women who also exercised had additional increases in <font color="red">BMD_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">femoral_1</font> <font color="red">neck_1</font> ( + 0.29% ) , <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">hip_1</font> ( + 0.34% ) , <font color="red">spine_1</font> ( + 0.23% ) , <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">radius_1</font> ( + 0.30% ) , and additional decreases in <font color="red">Alkphase_1</font> <font color="red">B_1</font> ( -2.4% ) and <font color="red">Serum_1</font> <font color="red">NTx_1</font> ( -6.5% ) . Additional changes in <font color="red">BMD_1</font> and <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">turnover_1</font> with exercise were not significant . Subjects who were > or = 50% adherent to exercise were less likely to lose <font color="red">BMD_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">hip_1</font> ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.66 , p = 0.03 ) and <font color="red">femoral_1</font> <font color="red">neck_1</font> ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.63 , p = 0.03 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Strength / weight training exercises may prevent loss of <font color="red">BMD_1</font> in postmenopausal BCS at risk for bone loss .
