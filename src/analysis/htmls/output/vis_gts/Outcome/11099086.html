Oral ciprofloxacin vs. intramuscular ceftriaxone as empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in children . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Acute invasive diarrhea is a potentially serious condition in children . Because of the increasing resistance of enteric pathogens to commonly used oral antibiotics , intramuscular ceftriaxone has become the routine drug in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea requiring an emergency visit in southern Israel . The inconvenience of this parenteral regimen created an increased need for oral pediatric formulations for the treatment of invasive diarrhea . 
<br> OBJECTIVES To evaluate the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> and <font color="red">safety_1</font> of a suspension formulation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in infants and children . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1996 through December 1997 , 201 evaluable children ages 6 months to 10 years ( 35% < 1 year ; 70% <3 years ) presenting with acute invasive diarrhea at the Pediatric Emergency Room were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin suspension ( 10 mg / kg twice a day + i m placebo ; n = 95 ) or i m ceftriaxone ( 50 mg / kg / day + placebo suspension ; n = 106 ) for 3 days in a double blind manner . <font color="red">Stool_1</font> <font color="red">cultures_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">Shigella_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Salmonella_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Campylobacter_1</font> <font color="red">spp_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">diarrheagenic_1</font> <font color="red">Escherichia_1</font> <font color="red">coli_1</font> were obtained on Days 1 , 3 , 4 to 5 and 21 + /- 5 . <font color="red">Clinical_1</font> <font color="red">response_1</font> and <font color="red">safety_1</font> were assessed on Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to 5 and 21 + /- 5 . 
<br> RESULTS We isolated 127 pathogens from 121 ( 60% ) patients : 73 ( 57% ) Shigella ; 23 ( 18% ) Salmonella ; 18 ( 14% ) E. coli ; and 13 ( 10% ) Campylobacter . <font color="red">Overall_1</font> <font color="red">bacteriologic_1</font> <font color="red">eradication_1</font> on Day 4 to 5 was 99% for Shigella , 77% for Salmonella and 77% for Campylobacter , with no difference between the 2 groups . <font color="red">Clinical_1</font> <font color="red">cure_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">improvement_1</font> was observed in 100 and 99% of the ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone groups , respectively . <font color="red">Serum_1</font> <font color="red">ciprofloxacin_1</font> <font color="red">values_1</font> determined on Day 3 of the treatment were higher in the majority of patients than were the MIC50 and MIC90 values for the Shigella and Salmonella spp . isolated . Possible <font color="red">drug_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">related_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> occurred in 13 patients [ ciprofloxacin , 8 ( 8% ) ; ceftriaxone , 5 ( 4.7% ) ] and were mild and transient . <font color="red">Joint_1</font> <font color="red">examination_1</font> was normal during and after completion of therapy in all patients . 
<br> CONCLUSION Oral ciprofloxacin was as <font color="red">safe_1</font> and <font color="red">effective_1</font> as intramuscular ceftriaxone for the empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in ambulatory pediatric patients requiring an emergency room visit .
