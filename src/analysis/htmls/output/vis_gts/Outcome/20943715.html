Visual and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training integrated with auditory step rhythm for <font color="red">walking_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> of patients with chronic stroke . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of visual and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training on <font color="red">walking_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> and to determine the <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">feasibility_1</font> of incorporating auditory step rhythm into the training . 
<br> DESIGN Randomized crossover trial . 
<br> SETTING Laboratory of a Department of Physical Therapy . 
<br> SUBJECTS Fifteen subjects with post - stroke hemiparesis . 
<br> INTERVENTION Four locomotor imagery trainings on walking performance : visual locomotor imagery training , kinesthetic locomotor imagery training , visual locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The <font color="red">timed_1</font> <font color="red">up_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">go_1</font> <font color="red">test_1</font> and <font color="red">electromyographic_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">kinematic_1</font> <font color="red">analyses_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">affected_1</font> <font color="red">lower_1</font> <font color="red">limb_1</font> <font color="red">during_1</font> <font color="red">one_1</font> <font color="red">gait_1</font> <font color="red">cycle_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS After the interventions , significant differences were found in the <font color="red">timed_1</font> <font color="red">up_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">go_1</font> <font color="red">test_1</font> <font color="red">results_1</font> between the visual locomotor imagery training ( 25.69 ± 16.16 to 23.97 ± 14.30 ) and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm ( 22.68 ± 12.35 to 15.77 ± 8.58 ) ( P < 0.05 ) . During the swing and stance phases , the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training exhibited significantly increased activation in a greater number of muscles and increased angular displacement of the knee and ankle joints compared with the visual locomotor imagery training , and these effects were more prominent when auditory step rhythm was integrated into each form of locomotor imagery training . The activation of the hamstring during the swing phase and the gastrocnemius during the stance phase , as well as kinematic data of the knee joint , were significantly different for posttest values between the visual locomotor imagery training and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm ( P < 0.05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic effect may be further enhanced in the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training than in the visual locomotor imagery training . The auditory step rhythm together with the locomotor imagery training produces a greater positive effect in improving the <font color="red">walking_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> of patients with post - stroke hemiparesis .
