Virtual reality hypnosis for <font color="red">pain_1</font> associated with recovery from physical trauma . 
<br>
<br> Pain following traumatic injuries is common , can impair injury recovery and is often inadequately treated . In particular , the role of adjunctive nonpharmacologic analgesic techniques is unclear . The authors report a randomized , controlled study of 21 hospitalized trauma patients to assess the analgesic efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis ( VRH)-hypnotic induction and analgesic suggestion delivered by customized virtual reality ( VR ) hardware / software . <font color="red">Subjective_1</font> <font color="red">pain_2</font> <font color="red">ratings_2</font> were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH ( used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care ) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone . VRH patients reported <font color="red">less_1</font> <font color="red">pain_3</font> <font color="red">intensity_3</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">less_1</font> <font color="red">pain_3</font> <font color="red">unpleasantness_3</font> compared to control groups . These preliminary findings suggest that VRH analgesia is a novel technology worthy of further study , both to improve <font color="red">pain_2</font> <font color="red">management_2</font> and to increase <font color="red">availability_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">hypnotic_1</font> <font color="red">analgesia_1</font> to populations without access to therapist - provided hypnosis and suggestion .
