Training referential communicative skills to individuals with autism spectrum disorder : a pilot study . 
<br>
<br> The present study reports the effects of referential communication training in individuals formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Participants were 20 children with ASD ( M age = 14.3 yr . , SD = 4.2 ; 6 girls , 14 boys ) in the role of speakers and 20 control children , who acted as listeners . They were all enrolled in mainstream compulsory education . Inclusion / exclusion criteria were defined according to the clinical diagnosis of ASD , the presence or absence of additional or associated disability , previous training in referential communication , and any drug treatment . Speakers were randomly assigned to one of two groups ( trained vs untrained ) . <font color="red">Linguistic_1</font> <font color="red">age_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">cognitive_1</font> <font color="red">level_1</font> and <font color="red">autistic_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> were analyzed , respectively , with the <font color="red">Peabody_1</font> <font color="red">Picture_1</font> <font color="red">Vocabulary_1</font> <font color="red">Test_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">PPVT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the <font color="red">Wechsler_1</font> <font color="red">Intelligence_1</font> <font color="red">Scale_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">WISC_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">R_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">WAIS_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">III_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and the <font color="red">Autistic_1</font> <font color="red">Behavior_1</font> <font color="red">Checklist_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ABC_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Communicative_1</font> <font color="red">abilities_1</font> were analyzed through two indexes related to message complexity and self - regulation . The trained group was trained in referential communication tasks ( task analysis , role taking , and task evaluation ) , while the untrained group took part in a communicative game but without any specific communicative training . The results showed that the complexity of emitted messages had improved statistically significantly in the trained group as an effect of training . Ecological referential communication is shown to be an appropriate paradigm for studying the communicative process and its products and could be used to develop and implement a training program focused on those skills in which individuals with ASD are most deficient .
