A double - blind , placebo - controlled study of fluvoxamine in adults with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction , impairments in communication , and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests . Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism . No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism . 
<br> METHODS Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate . <font color="red">Behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">ratings_1</font> were obtained at baseline and after 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks of treatment . 
<br> RESULTS Eight ( 53% ) of 15 patients in the fluvoxamine - treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the placebo group ( P = .001 ) . Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing <font color="red">repetitive_1</font> <font color="red">thoughts_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">behavior_1</font> ( P < .001 ) , <font color="red">maladaptive_1</font> <font color="red">behavior_1</font> ( P < .001 ) , and <font color="red">aggression_1</font> ( P < .03 ) , and in improving some aspects of <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">relatedness_1</font> ( P < .04 ) , especially <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">usage_1</font> ( P < .008 ) . Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior , or full - scale IQ . Other than <font color="red">mild_1</font> <font color="red">sedation_1</font> and <font color="red">nausea_1</font> in a few patients , fluvoxamine was well tolerated . No <font color="red">dyskinesias_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">cardiovascular_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> or <font color="red">seizures_1</font> occurred . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short - term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults . Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism .
