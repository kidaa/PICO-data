Effect of duloxetine on <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">function_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> among patients with chemotherapy - induced painful peripheral neuropathy : a randomized clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> IMPORTANCE There are no known effective treatments for painful chemotherapy - induced peripheral neuropathy . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of duloxetine , 60 mg daily , on <font color="red">average_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">severity_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover trial at 8 National Cancer Institute ( NCI)-funded cooperative research networks that enrolled 231 patients who were 25 years or older being treated at community and academic settings between April 2008 and March 2011 . Study follow - up was completed July 2012 . Stratified by chemotherapeutic drug and comorbid pain risk , patients were randomized to receive either duloxetine followed by placebo or placebo followed by duloxetine . Eligibility required that patients have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 , representing average chemotherapy - induced pain , after paclitaxel , other taxane , or oxaliplatin treatment . 
<br> INTERVENTIONS The initial treatment consisted of taking 1 capsule daily of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo for the first week and 2 capsules of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo daily for 4 additional weeks . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary hypothesis was that duloxetine would be more effective than placebo in decreasing <font color="red">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">induced_1</font> <font color="red">peripheral_1</font> <font color="red">neuropathic_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Pain severity was assessed using the <font color="red">Brief_1</font> <font color="red">Pain_1</font> <font color="red">Inventory_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">Short_1</font> <font color="red">Form_1</font> <font color="red">"_1</font> <font color="red">average_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">"_1</font> <font color="red">item_1</font> with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing as bad as can be imagined . 
<br> RESULTS Individuals receiving duloxetine as their initial 5-week treatment reported a mean decrease in <font color="red">average_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> of 1.06 ( 95% CI , 0.72 - 1.40 ) vs 0.34 ( 95% CI , 0.01 - 0.66 ) among those who received placebo ( P = .003 ; effect size , 0.513 ) . The observed mean difference in the <font color="red">average_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">score_1</font> between duloxetine and placebo was 0.73 ( 95% CI , 0.26 - 1.20 ) . Fifty - nine percent of those initially receiving duloxetine vs 38% of those initially receiving placebo reported decreased <font color="red">pain_1</font> of any amount . 
<br> CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among patients with painful chemotherapy - induced peripheral neuropathy , the use of duloxetine compared with placebo for 5 weeks resulted in a greater reduction in <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
