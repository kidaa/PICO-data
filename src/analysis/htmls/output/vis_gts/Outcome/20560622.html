Influence of diets rich in Maillard reaction products on <font color="red">calcium_1</font> <font color="red">bioavailability_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Assays in male adolescents and in Caco-2 cells . 
<br>
<br> The effects of the high intake of Maillard reaction products ( MRP ) on <font color="red">calcium_1</font> <font color="red">availability_1</font> in adolescents and across Caco-2 cell monolayers were examined . In a 2 week randomized two - period crossover trial , 18 male adolescents consumed two diets , named white diet ( WD ) and brown diet ( BD ) , which were poor and rich in MRP , respectively . A 3 day balance was performed at the end of each period , and <font color="red">fasting_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">samples_1</font> were collected . <font color="red">Calcium_1</font> <font color="red">solubility_1</font> and <font color="red">absorption_1</font> <font color="red">across_1</font> <font color="red">Caco-2_1</font> <font color="red">cells_1</font> were studied after the in vitro digestion of the diets . The in vitro assay showed similar <font color="red">solubility_1</font> after the in vitro digestion and similar <font color="red">transport_1</font> <font color="red">across_1</font> <font color="red">Caco-2_1</font> <font color="red">cells_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In accordance , <font color="red">calcium_1</font> <font color="red">bioavailability_1</font> in adolescents did not vary between the diets ( % WD = 40.4 + /- 5.1 , % BD = 38.2 + /- 3.6 ) . <font color="red">Serum_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">urine_1</font> <font color="red">biochemical_1</font> <font color="red">parameters_1</font> related to <font color="red">calcium_1</font> <font color="red">status_1</font> and <font color="red">bone_1</font> <font color="red">metabolism_1</font> remained unaltered . Only <font color="red">deoxypyridinoline_1</font> <font color="red">values_1</font> were significantly lower after consumption of the BD ( 13.0 + /- 1.1 compared to 18.3 + /- 2.1 nM / Mm Cr in the WD ) , possibly indicative of less efficient bone turnover during this period . As calcium acquired during adolescence is essential to maximize peak bone mass and to prevent osteoporosis , possible long - term effects of excessive MRP intake during this period warrant attention .
