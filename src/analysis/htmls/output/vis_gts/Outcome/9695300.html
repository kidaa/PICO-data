Salbutamol or mist in acute bronchiolitis . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The role of bronchodilators in the treatment of bronchiolitis remains controversial . 
<br> METHODS A double - blind , placebo controlled trial was performed to evaluate the <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">response_1</font> to nebulized salbutamol . One hundred and fifty - six infants aged between 7 weeks and 24 months who had had an episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomized to three groups as follows : ( i ) nebulized salbutamol was administered to 52 patients in group I at a dose of 0.15 mg / kg in 2 mL saline ; ( ii ) saline was nebulized to 52 patients in group II and ( iii ) in group III 52 patients received mist in a tent . All three groups were administered oxygen during the procedures . Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 min if the respiratory score was 5 or more . <font color="red">Respiratory_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">heart_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">oxygen_1</font> <font color="red">saturation_1</font> and <font color="red">presence_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">cyanosis_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">wheezing_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">retractions_1</font> were recorded before and after each treatment . 
<br> RESULTS The decrease in the <font color="red">respiratory_1</font> <font color="red">score_1</font> was 5.2 + /- 1.8 , 0.82 + /- 2.4 and 1.7 + /- 1.3 in group I , II and III , respectively . The decrease in group I was significantly higher than in the other groups . <font color="red">Heart_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> was similar between groups . <font color="red">Oxygen_1</font> <font color="red">saturation_1</font> decreased in group I without reaching statistical significance . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Salbutamol was shown to be <font color="red">effective_1</font> and <font color="red">safe_1</font> in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis .
