[ Effect of liu wei di huang or jin gui shen qi decoction as on adjuvant treatment in small cell lung cancer ] . 
<br>
<br> Eighty - three patients with small cell lung cancer were randomized with or without using a traditional Chinese Kidney - tonifying decoction ( Liu Wei Di Huang or Jin Gui Shen Qi medicinal decoction ) in chemotherapy or radiotherapy courses . 74 patients were availble to be analysis . The two treatment groups were well - matched in age , sex , stage and performance status . There was a statistically significant difference in <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> and the <font color="red">median_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> between two groups . The <font color="red">overall_1</font> <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CR+PR_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> was 91.5% for Chinese herb group and 46.9% for control group ( P less than 0.001 ) . The <font color="red">median_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> was 16 months for the traditional Chinese Kidney - tonifying decoction group , and 10 months for the control group ( P less than 0.05 ) . <font color="red">Survival_1</font> <font color="red">curve_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Kaplan_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">meire_1</font> <font color="red">'s_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> of the Chinese herb group was better than that of the control group . 10 patients of Chinese herb group was alive beyond more than 2 years . Until now , 4 patients in the Chinese herb group , one in the control group are still enjoying their disease - free life for more than 7 years . <font color="red">Hematologic_1</font> <font color="red">toxicities_1</font> were observed much frequently in the patients of the control group ( P less than 0.005 and 0.01/WBC and BPC ) . Results of animal experiments with the same traditional medicinal decoctions as used in clinic have showed immuno - enhancement activities . These results have showed that the traditional Chinese Kidney - tonifying decoction may enhance non - specific immunology activities and may be much useful for solid cancer patients as an adjuvant treatment .
