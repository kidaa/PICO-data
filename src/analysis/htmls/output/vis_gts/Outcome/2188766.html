Chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan in congestive heart failure . 
<br>
<br> This study was conducted to determine the <font color="red">long_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">term_1</font> <font color="red">effect_1</font> of flosequinan , a new orally administered arterial and venous dilator , on the clinical course of patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure . Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either flosequinan ( n = 9 ) or placebo ( n = 8) in a double - blind fashion . Changes in <font color="red">symptomatology_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">left_1</font> <font color="red">ventricular_1</font> <font color="red">function_1</font> were assessed serially during the two - month treatment period . During the course of therapy , a modest improvement in the <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> and <font color="red">functional_1</font> <font color="red">classification_1</font> of the flosequinan - treated patients was observed . Flosequinan evoked a significant increase in <font color="red">maximal_1</font> <font color="red">exercise_1</font> <font color="red">capacity_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> While long - term flosequinan administration also effected a progressive increase in <font color="red">resting_1</font> <font color="red">heart_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> it did not consistently improve indices of <font color="red">left_1</font> <font color="red">ventricular_1</font> <font color="red">systolic_1</font> <font color="red">function_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The addition of chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan to standard digitalis - diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure . Trials involving larger patient populations will be necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary study and to determine the extent of clinical improvement , subpopulations benefited , role in heart failure therapeutics , and so forth .
