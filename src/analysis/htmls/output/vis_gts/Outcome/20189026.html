Remote ischaemic conditioning before hospital admission , as a complement to angioplasty , and effect on <font color="red">myocardial_1</font> <font color="red">salvage_1</font> in patients with acute myocardial infarction : a randomised trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Remote ischaemic preconditioning attenuates cardiac injury at elective surgery and angioplasty . We tested the hypothesis that remote ischaemic conditioning during evolving ST - elevation myocardial infarction , and done before primary percutaneous coronary intervention , increases <font color="red">myocardial_1</font> <font color="red">salvage_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS 333 consecutive adult patients with a suspected first acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by computerised block randomisation to receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention with ( n=166 patients ) versus without ( n=167 ) remote conditioning ( intermittent arm ischaemia through four cycles of 5-min inflation and 5-min deflation of a blood - pressure cuff ) . Allocation was concealed with opaque sealed envelopes . Patients received remote conditioning during transport to hospital , and primary percutaneous coronary intervention in hospital . The primary endpoint was <font color="red">myocardial_1</font> <font color="red">salvage_1</font> <font color="red">index_1</font> at 30 days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention , measured by myocardial perfusion imaging as the proportion of the area at risk salvaged by treatment ; analysis was per protocol . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00435266 . 
<br> FINDINGS 82 patients were excluded on arrival at hospital because they did not meet inclusion criteria , 32 were lost to follow - up , and 77 did not complete the follow - up with data for salvage index . <font color="red">Median_1</font> <font color="red">salvage_1</font> <font color="red">index_1</font> was 0.75 ( IQR 0.50 - 0.93 , n=73 ) in the remote conditioning group versus 0.55 ( 0.35 - 0.88 , n=69 ) in the control group , with median difference of 0.10 ( 95% CI 0.01 - 0.22 ; p=0.0333 ) ; <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">salvage_1</font> <font color="red">index_1</font> was 0.69 ( SD 0.27 ) versus 0.57 ( 0.26 ) , with mean difference of 0.12 ( 95% CI 0.01 - 0.21 ; p=0.0333 ) . <font color="red">Major_1</font> <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">coronary_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> were <font color="red">death_1</font> ( n=3 per group ) , <font color="red">reinfarction_1</font> ( n=1 per group ) , and <font color="red">heart_1</font> <font color="red">failure_1</font> ( n=3 per group ) . 
<br> INTERPRETATION Remote ischaemic conditioning before hospital admission increases <font color="red">myocardial_1</font> <font color="red">salvage_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and has a favourable <font color="red">safety_1</font> profile . Our findings merit a larger trial to establish the effect of remote conditioning on clinical outcomes .
