Custom - fit minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty : effect on <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">loss_1</font> and <font color="red">early_1</font> <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">outcomes_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE Recently , new custom - fit pin guides in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) have been introduced . Use of these guides may reduce operating time . Use of the guides combined with the absence of intramedullary alignment jigs may lead to reduced <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">loss_1</font> and improved <font color="red">early_1</font> <font color="red">outcomes_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Our aim was to evaluate <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">loss_1</font> and <font color="red">early_1</font> <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">outcomes_1</font> in patients undergoing minimally invasive TKA using custom - fit magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)-based pin guides . 
<br> METHODS A prospective study in 80 patients was carried out . Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups . In one group , intramedullary alignment jigs were used . In the second group , custom - fit MRI - based pin guides were used . All patients received the same cemented posterior - stabilized implant through a mini - midvastus approach . The volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. <font color="red">Hb_1</font> <font color="red">loss_1</font> was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative Hb level . <font color="red">Transfusion_1</font> <font color="red">requirements_1</font> and <font color="red">surgical_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> were recorded . Outcome measures were <font color="red">Knee_1</font> <font color="red">Society_1</font> <font color="red">Scores_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">KSS_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">knee_1</font> <font color="red">flexion_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">knee_1</font> <font color="red">swelling_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS There was lower mean <font color="red">drainage_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> in the custom - fit group ( 391 ml vs. 603 ml ; p < 0.0001 ) . There was no difference in estimated <font color="red">loss_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">Hb_1</font> ( 3.6 g / dl vs. 4.1 g / dl ; n.s . ) and in <font color="red">transfusion_1</font> <font color="red">requirements_1</font> ( 7.5 % vs. 10 % ; n.s . ) . <font color="red">Surgical_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> was reduced in the custom - fit group ( 12 min less ; p = 0.001 ) . <font color="red">KSS_1</font> measured at week 2 , 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups . <font color="red">Knee_1</font> <font color="red">flexion_1</font> measured on days 7 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 and <font color="red">knee_1</font> <font color="red">swelling_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> measured on days 1 , 3 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 showed no significant difference between groups . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Using custom - fit pin guides reduces <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">drainage_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> but not the <font color="red">estimated_1</font> <font color="red">Hb_1</font> <font color="red">loss_1</font> in minimally invasive TKA and does not affect <font color="red">transfusion_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">Surgical_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> is reduced . There is no effect on the <font color="red">early_1</font> <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">outcomes_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
