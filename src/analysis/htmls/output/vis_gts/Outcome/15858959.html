Effects of Saccharomyces boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea . 
<br>
<br> AIM Certain probiotic agents , e.g. Lactobacillus GG , have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea , but few studies have examined the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii . We evaluated the effect of S. boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea . 
<br> METHODS Two hundred children were randomized to receive S. boulardii in a granulated form in a daily dose of 250 mg ( S. boulardii group ) or placebo ( placebo group ) for 5 d. Clinical and demographic characteristics on admission were similar between the study groups . 
<br> RESULTS The medians of the <font color="red">average_1</font> <font color="red">stool_1</font> <font color="red">frequency_1</font> after the second day of the treatment were significantly lower in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group ( p = 0.003 ) . The <font color="red">duration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhoea_1</font> significantly reduced in the S. boulardii group compared with the placebo group ( 4.7 vs 5.5 d , p = 0.03 ) . The effect of S. boulardii on <font color="red">watery_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhoea_1</font> became apparent after the second day of the treatment . The <font color="red">duration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">hospital_1</font> <font color="red">stay_1</font> was shorter in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group ( 2.9 vs 3.9 d , p < 0.001 ) . Four children from the placebo group versus only one child from the S. boulardii group had <font color="red">persisting_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhoea_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSION The placebo - controlled study suggested that S. boulardii significantly reduced the <font color="red">duration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhoea_1</font> and the <font color="red">duration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">hospital_1</font> <font color="red">stay_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> S. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhoea_1</font> in children when used therapeutically .
