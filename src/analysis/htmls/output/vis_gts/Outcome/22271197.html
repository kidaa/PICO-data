We tested assumptions of equality between GAS descriptions for outcome measurement in a randomized trial ( i.e. , measurability , equidistance , level of difficulty , comparability of behavior samples collected from teachers vs. researchers and live vs. videotape ) . Results suggest <font color="red">GAS_1</font> descriptions can be evaluated for equivalency , that teacher collected behavior samples are representative , and that varied sources of behavior samples can be reliably coded . <font color="red">GAS_1</font> is a promising measurement approach . Recommendations are provided to ensure methodological quality .
