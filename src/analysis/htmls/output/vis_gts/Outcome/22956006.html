A randomized double - blind placebo - controlled cross - over trial of the impact on <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> of continuing dexamethasone beyond 24   h following adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . 
<br>
<br> Uncertainty remains about the optimal anti - emetic regimen for control of delayed nausea and vomiting after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . Many patients receive dexamethasone but complain of insomnia , anxiety / agitation , and indigestion . The aim was to determine if patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer prefer treatment with dexamethasone or placebo for prophylaxis against delayed nausea and vomiting , and to compare <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> between the two treatments . In this randomized , double - blind , cross - over trial , we compared oral dexamethasone ( 4   mg twice daily for 2   days ) versus placebo for chemotherapy - naïve patients with breast cancer . All patients received intravenous granisetron and dexamethasone pre - chemotherapy and oral granisetron on day 2 . Primary endpoints were : ( i ) <font color="red">patient_1</font> <font color="red">preference_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> ( ii ) difference between cycles in <font color="red">change_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> from days 1 to 8 . Median age of the 94 women was 51   years ( range 27 - 76 ) : 79 received fluorouracil / epirubicin / cyclophosphamide and 15 received doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide . Thirteen withdrew pre - cycle 2 with no differences between arms . Of 80 patients stating a preference , 31 preferred placebo ( 39   % , 95   % CI : 28 - 50   % ) and 37 ( 46   % , 95   % CI : 35 - 58   % ) preferred dexamethasone ; 12 had no preference . There were no differences in <font color="red">intensity_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">vomiting_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">nausea_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> or <font color="red">time_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">onset_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">vomiting_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> There was greater decrease in <font color="red">global_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> ( p   =   0.06 ) when patients received dexamethasone . No other <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">/_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> <font color="red">domains_1</font> differed significantly . In conclusion , no significant difference was found in <font color="red">patient_1</font> <font color="red">preference_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">QOL_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> or <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> regardless of whether dexamethasone or placebo was used after adjuvant chemotherapy .
