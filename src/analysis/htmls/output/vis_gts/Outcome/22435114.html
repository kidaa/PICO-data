Group cognitive behavior therapy for children with high - functioning autism spectrum disorders and anxiety : a randomized trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Children with high - functioning autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety . Anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school , home and community environments . Cognitive behavioral therapies ( CBT ) are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms . Modified CBT interventions for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded promising results . 
<br> METHODS Fifty children with high - functioning ASD and anxiety were randomizedto group CBT or treatment - as - usual ( TAU ) for 12 weeks . Independent clinical evaluators , blind to condition , completed structured interviews ( <font color="red">Anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">Disorders_1</font> <font color="red">Interview_1</font> <font color="red">Schedule_1</font> <font color="red">â€“_1</font> <font color="red">Parent_1</font> <font color="red">Version;ADIS_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">P_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> pre- and post - intervention condition . 
<br> RESULTS Forty - seven children completed either the CBT or TAU condition . Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the CBT group .

<br> CONCLUSIONS Initial results from this randomized , designed treatment study suggest that agroup CBT intervention specifically developed for children with ASD may be effective in decreasing anxiety . Limitations of this study include small sample size , lack of an attention control group , and use of outcome measures normed with typically developing children
