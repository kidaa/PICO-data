Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders : A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study . 
<br>
<br> This pilot and feasibility study examined the impact of a sensory adapted dental environment ( SADE ) to reduce <font color="red">distress_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">sensory_1</font> <font color="red">discomfort_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">perception_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> during oral prophylaxis for children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Participants were 44 children ages 6 - 12 ( n = 22 typical , n = 22 ASD ) . In an experimental crossover design , each participant underwent two professional dental cleanings , one in a regular dental environment ( RDE ) and one in a SADE , administered in a randomized and counterbalanced order 3 - 4 months apart . Outcomes included measures of <font color="red">physiological_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">behavioral_1</font> <font color="red">distress_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">intensity_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">sensory_1</font> <font color="red">discomfort_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Both groups exhibited decreased <font color="red">physiological_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> and reported lower <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">sensory_1</font> <font color="red">discomfort_1</font> in the SADE condition compared to RDE , indicating a beneficial effect of the SADE .
