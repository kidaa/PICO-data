Randomized phase II study of two different schedules of gemcitabine and oral S-1 in chemo - naïve patients with advanced non - small cell lung cancer . 
<br>
<br> INTRODUCTION This study was conducted to evaluate the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> and <font color="red">safety_1</font> and to compare dosing schedules of gemcitabine combined with S-1 in chemo - naïve non - small cell lung cancer patients . 
<br> METHODS Patients with chemo - naïve stage IIIB / IV non - small cell lung cancer were randomized into two treatment arms . Patients were given oral S-1 ( 60 mg / m / d , twice a day ) from days 1 to 14 with gemcitabine ( 1000 mg / m / d ) on days 1 and 8 ( arm A ) or on days 8 and 15 ( arm B ) . This cycle was repeated every 21 days . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 80 patients were entered in this trial . The primary end point of this study was <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">rates_1</font> of arm A and arm B were 22.0 and 28.9% , respectively ( p = 0.606 ) . <font color="red">Median_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">failure_1</font> in arm A was 3.6 months and 4.8 months in arm B. <font color="red">Median_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">progression_1</font> in arm A was 4.1 months and 5.5 months in arm B. <font color="red">Median_1</font> <font color="red">survival_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> in arm A and arm B was 15.5 months and 18.8 months , respectively . The <font color="red">toxicity_1</font> <font color="red">profile_1</font> was relatively mild and did not differ very much between two arms . 
<br> CONCLUSION The combination of gemcitabine and S-1 was determined to be <font color="red">feasible_1</font> and <font color="red">effective_1</font> for advanced non - small cell lung cancer . We selected arm B for further studies because of its higher <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> and <font color="red">survival_1</font> <font color="red">data_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
