A randomized controlled study of a social skills training for preadolescent children with autism spectrum disorders : generalization of skills by training parents and teachers ? 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Social skills training ( SST ) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) to improve their social and communication skills . Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice , the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive . Moreover , long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated . Additionally , there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life . We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> and to facilitate <font color="red">generalization_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">learned_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">daily_1</font> <font color="red">life_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHOD / DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with three conditions , 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school ( 10 - 12 years of calendar age ) have been randomized to SST , SST - PTI ( SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement ) , or care - as - usual . The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children . In the SST - PTI condition , parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments . Assessment takes place at three moments : before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow - up . Primary outcome is <font color="red">socialization_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> as an aspect of adaptive functioning . Secondary outcomes focus on <font color="red">specific_1</font> <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> children learn during SST and on more <font color="red">general_1</font> <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> pertaining to home and community settings from a multi - informant perspective . Additionally , possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed . 
<br> DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range ( 10 - 12 years ) . Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol , application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments , use of multiple raters , investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life , and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow - up measures at 6 months after the end of training .
