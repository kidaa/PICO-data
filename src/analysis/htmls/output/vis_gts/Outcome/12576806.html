Is a 2-week duration sufficient for stenting in endopyelotomy ? 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE Internal stenting is an integral part of endopyelotomy . Studies in animals show good healing after 1 to 2 weeks of ureterotomy . Inherent stent related problems warrant a minimum possible duration of stenting without compromising the results of endopyelotomy . We performed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the optimum duration of stenting after endopyelotomy . 
<br> MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 57 consecutive patients with primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction were randomized to undergo 7/14Fr internal endopyelotomy stent placement for 2 ( group 1 ) and 4 ( group 2 ) weeks . A symptom based questionnaire was administered to all patients at stent removal . Followup was done with diuretic scanning at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months and then yearly , and thereafter with diuretic renography . 
<br> RESULTS In each group 26 patients were available for evaluation . The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age , sex , symptoms and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate . Mean followup was 22.3 ( range 12 to 36 ) and 21.3 months ( range 12 to 35 ) in groups 1 and 2 , respectively . At the end of 1 year 24 group 1 ( 92.3% ) and 23 group 2 ( 90.3% ) patients had an improved <font color="red">drainage_1</font> <font color="red">pattern_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> This difference was not significant . <font color="red">Stent_1</font> <font color="red">related_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> were present in a good proportion of patients in groups 1 and 2 but there was a significant difference in the <font color="red">incidence_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">urinary_1</font> <font color="red">tract_1</font> <font color="red">infections_1</font> ( 11.5% versus 38.1% , p = 0.04 ) . Of the group 2 patients 64% preferred 2 weeks of stenting . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Two weeks seems to be a sufficient duration to allow functional restoration across the ureteropelvic junction after endopyelotomy and decrease stent related complications .
