[ The chemotherapy of advanced breast cancer . A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study ( 1974 - 1977 ) ( author 's transl ) ] . 
<br>
<br> The authors explain the objectives and the structure of a programme evolved for the methodic study of advanced breast cancers which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the departments of medicine in eight French anticancer centres . They analyse the initial phases , which correspond to the three first years of work . They give the state of the results that have been obtained in 603 patients using three protocols for treatment . These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of chemotherapy which consisted of vincristine associated for the one part with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluoro - uracil and on the other hand with doxorubicine or / and with methotrexate . From this study there emerged the value of combined therapy using doxorubicine as much because of the <font color="red">frequency_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">which_1</font> <font color="red">results_1</font> <font color="red">better_1</font> <font color="red">than_1</font> <font color="red">50%_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">obtained_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">randomised_1</font> <font color="red">trial_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> as by their <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases . They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all complex therapy which aims as much at palliation as at cure , and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an anticancer therapy .
