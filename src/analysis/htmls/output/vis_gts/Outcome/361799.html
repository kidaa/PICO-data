[ The chemotherapy of <font color="red">advanced_1</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study ( 1974 - 1977 ) ( author 's transl ) ] . 
<br>
<br> The authors explain the <font color="red">objectives_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">structure_1</font> of a programme evolved for the methodic study of <font color="red">advanced_1</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancers_2</font> which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the departments of medicine in eight French anticancer centres . They analyse the initial phases , which correspond to the three first years of work . They give the state of the results that have been obtained in 603 patients using three protocols for treatment . These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of chemotherapy which consisted of <font color="red">vincristine_1</font> associated for the one part with <font color="red">cyclophosphamide_1</font> and <font color="red">5-fluoro_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">uracil_1</font> and on the other hand with <font color="red">doxorubicine_1</font> or / and with <font color="red">methotrexate_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> From this study there emerged the <font color="red">value_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">combined_2</font> <font color="red">therapy_2</font> using <font color="red">doxorubicine_1</font> as much because of the <font color="red">frequency_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">which_1</font> <font color="red">results_1</font> <font color="red">better_1</font> than 50% were obtained ( in a randomised trial ) <font color="red">as_1</font> <font color="red">by_2</font> <font color="red">their_2</font> <font color="red">quality_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases . They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all <font color="red">complex_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> which aims as much at <font color="red">palliation_2</font> <font color="red">as_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">cure_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and point out how important it is to be <font color="red">methodical_1</font> in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an <font color="red">anticancer_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
