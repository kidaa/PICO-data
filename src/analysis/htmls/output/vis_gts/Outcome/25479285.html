Randomised trial of text messaging on <font color="red">adherence_1</font> to cardiovascular preventive treatment ( INTERACT trial ) . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND About one third of patients prescribed blood pressure or lipid - lowering drugs for the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke do not take their medication as prescribed . We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate text messaging as a means of improving <font color="red">adherence_1</font> to cardiovascular disease preventive treatment . 
<br> METHODS 303 patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid - lowering medications were randomly assigned to being sent text messages ( Text group , 151 ) or not being sent them ( No text group , 152 ) . Texts were sent daily for 2 weeks , alternate days for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter for 22 weeks ( 6 months overall ) , using an automated computer programme . Patients were asked to respond on whether they had taken their medication , whether the text reminded them to do so if they had forgotten , and if they had not taken their medication to determine if there was a reason for not doing so . At 6 months , use of medication was assessed . 
<br> RESULTS Two patients were lost to follow - up , providing data on 301 for analysis . In the No text group 38/151 ( 25% ) took less than 80% of the prescribed regimen ( ie . <font color="red">stopped_1</font> <font color="red">medication_1</font> <font color="red">completely_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">took_1</font> <font color="red">it_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">fewer_1</font> <font color="red">than_1</font> <font color="red">22_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">last_1</font> <font color="red">28_1</font> <font color="red">days_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">follow_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">up_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> compared to 14/150 patients ( 9% ) in the Text group - an improvement in <font color="red">adherence_1</font> affecting 16 per 100 patients ( 95% CI 7 to 24 ) , p<0.001 . The texts reminded 98/151 patients ( 65% ) to <font color="red">take_1</font> <font color="red">medication_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">least_1</font> <font color="red">one_1</font> <font color="red">occasion_1</font> and lead to 20/151 ( 13% ) <font color="red">who_1</font> <font color="red">stopped_1</font> <font color="red">taking_1</font> <font color="red">medication_1</font> <font color="red">because_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">concern_1</font> <font color="red">over_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">side_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">effects_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">resuming_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In patients taking blood pressure or lipid - lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , text messaging improved <font color="red">medication_1</font> <font color="red">adherence_1</font> compared with no text messaging .
