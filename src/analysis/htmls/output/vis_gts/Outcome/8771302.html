Fluoroscopic functional evaluation of bileaflet prostheses : effect of different intraoperative valve orientation . 
<br>
<br> Fluoroscopy is a reliable , easy , and readily available technique to follow - up prosthesis functioning after heart valve surgery . The different orientation given to the prosthesis may represent a limitation of the technique accounting for unsatisfactory results in 10% to 40% of the cases . The aim of the study was to evaluate whether and to what extent different intraoperative valve orientation influence <font color="red">feasibility_1</font> and <font color="red">accuracy_1</font> of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluation of bileaflet prostheses . We prospectively evaluated 90 patients who had aortic , mitral , and/or tricuspid valve replacement with Sorin Bicarbon or CarboMedics bileaflet prostheses . Fifty percent of the patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive prostheses oriented in a perpendicular or a parallel position with respect to the ventricular septum . Fluoroscopic evaluation was considered appropriate when the prosthesis ' " tilting disk " projection was obtained . The valve 's <font color="red">hemodynamic_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> was investigated through Doppler study . A <font color="red">proper_1</font> <font color="red">fluoroscopic_1</font> <font color="red">evaluation_1</font> was rapidly ( 15 + /- 5 seconds ) achieved in all patients with the former orientation , whereas it was impossible to obtain it in 8 of 20 ( 40% ) , 19 of 20 ( 95% ) , and 4 of 5 ( 80% ) of patients with the latter orientation . In the remaining patients extremely angulated , uneasy projection was often required to get a correct fluoroscopic image . The Doppler study showed a similarly favorable <font color="red">hemodynamic_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> regardless of valve orientation . Prosthesis orientation crucially affects the <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">success_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">fluoroscopic_1</font> <font color="red">evaluation_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The orientation perpendicular to the ventricular septum greatly facilitates the <font color="red">postoperative_1</font> <font color="red">feasibility_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">accuracy_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">fluoroscopy_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and it is not detrimental to the valve 's <font color="red">hemodynamic_1</font> <font color="red">performance_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> This valve orientation may provide a better <font color="red">fluoroscopic_1</font> <font color="red">window_1</font> whenever a valve dysfunction is suspected .
