Eltrombopag for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( RAISE ) : a 6-month , randomised , phase 3 study . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist for the treatment of thrombocytopenia . We aimed to compare the response to once daily eltrombopag versus placebo in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia during a 6-month period . 
<br> METHODS We undertook a phase 3 , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months ' duration who had baseline platelet counts lower than 30,000 per μL. Patients were randomly allocated ( in a 2:1 ratio ) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months . Randomisation was done centrally with a computer - generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count ( ≤ 15,000 per μL ) , use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia , and splenectomy status . Patients , investigators , and those assessing data were masked to allocation . Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response . Patients were assessed for <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> ( defined as a platelet count of 50,000 - 400,000 per μL ) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter ; the primary endpoint was the <font color="red">odds_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">response_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">eltrombopag_1</font> <font color="red">versus_1</font> <font color="red">placebo_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00370331 . 
<br> FINDINGS Between Nov 22 , 2006 , and July 31 , 2007 , 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention - to - treat analysis ( 135 eltrombopag , 62 placebo ) . 106 ( 79% ) patients in the eltrombopag group responded to treatment at least once during the study , compared with 17 ( 28% ) patients in the placebo group . The <font color="red">odds_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">responding_1</font> were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period ( odds ratio 8·2 , 99% CI 3·59 - 18·73 ; p<0·0001 ) . 37 ( 59% ) patients receiving eltrombopag reduced <font color="red">concomitant_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> versus ten ( 32% ) patients receiving placebo ( p=0·016 ) . 24 ( 18% ) patients receiving eltrombopag needed <font color="red">rescue_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> compared with 25 ( 40% ) patients receiving placebo ( p=0·001 ) . Three ( 2% ) patients receiving eltrombopag had <font color="red">thromboembolic_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> compared with none in patients on placebo . Nine ( 7% ) eltrombopag - treated patients and two ( 3% ) in the placebo group had mild increases in <font color="red">alanine_1</font> <font color="red">aminotransferase_1</font> <font color="red">concentration_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and five ( 4% ) eltrombopag - treated patients ( vs none allocated to placebo ) had increases in <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">bilirubin_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Four ( 7% ) patients taking placebo had <font color="red">serious_1</font> <font color="red">bleeding_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> compared with one ( < 1% ) patient treated with eltrombopag . 
<br> INTERPRETATION Eltrombopag is effective for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia , and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment . These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with eltrombopag treatment .
