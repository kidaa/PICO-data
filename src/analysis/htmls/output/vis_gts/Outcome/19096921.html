Trial design challenges when combining medication and parent training in children with pervasive developmental disorders . 
<br>
<br> This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week , randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of <font color="red">noncompliance_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">irritability_1</font> and <font color="red">adaptive_1</font> <font color="red">functioning_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In this model , medication reduces <font color="red">tantrums_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">aggression_1</font> and <font color="red">self_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">injury_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> parent training promotes improvement in <font color="red">noncompliance_1</font> and <font color="red">adaptive_1</font> <font color="red">functioning_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Thus , medication and parent training target related , but separate , outcomes . At week 24 , the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse . Both <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">reduction_1</font> and <font color="red">functional_1</font> <font color="red">improvement_1</font> are important clinical treatment targets . Thus , experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice .
