Prediction of <font color="red">creatinine_1</font> <font color="red">clearance_1</font> from serum creatinine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis : comparison of six formulae and one nomogram . 
<br>
<br> The estimation of glomerular filtration rate is important for the medical treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . However , the determination of <font color="red">endogenous_1</font> <font color="red">creatinine_1</font> <font color="red">clearance_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">Clcr_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> from a 24-h urine collection is an unreliable and time - consuming procedure . We therefore tested the accuracy of six equations and one nomogram for the prediction of <font color="red">Clcr_1</font> from serum creatinine ( Scr ) in 38 patients with RA and 20 controls . A positive correlation was found for all methods in the controls ( r = 0.83 - 0.94 ) and RA patients ( r = 0.51 - 0.69 ) . The methods did not overestimate <font color="red">Clcr_1</font> in RA . In the RA group the simple formula published by Cockcroft [ Clcr = ( ( 140 - age ) x body weight)/(72 x Scr ) , x 0.85 for females ] showed the best correlation with the measured <font color="red">Clcr_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In RA the Cockroft formula can reliably be used to predict <font color="red">Clcr_1</font> from Scr .
