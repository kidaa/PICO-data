<br>
<br> BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the <font color="red">course_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">depression_1</font> for patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and to investigate predictors of depression . 
<br> METHODS Twenty - two patients with a history of recently diagnosed RA of less than 2 years were assessed on a variety of <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">outcome_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">process_1</font> <font color="red">measures_1</font> on six assessment occasions over a 21-month period . These 22 patients constituted the control group of a controlled trial and received standard outpatient clinic treatment during follow - up . 
<br> RESULTS Patients became significantly more depressed over time . A set of five factors were found to consistently predict depression at the following assessment . These were initial level of depression , disability , pain , beliefs about the consequences of arthritis and coping strategies . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The results confirm the importance of psychological factors in early RA and their relative independence from physical findings . This is the first study to document the importance of illness perceptions in recent onset RA .
