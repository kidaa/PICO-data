<br> Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may affect <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">BP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment , but data on the effects of low - dose aspirin are scanty . This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin ( 100 mg / day ) on <font color="red">clinic_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">ambulatory_1</font> <font color="red">systolic_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">SBP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">diastolic_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">DBP_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">BP_1</font> in hypertensives on chronic , stable antihypertensive therapy . The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project ( PPP ) , a randomized , controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors . Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients ( 76 men , 66 women ; mean age 59 + /- 5.9 years ) treated with different antihypertensive drugs : 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls . All patients underwent a <font color="red">clinic_1</font> <font color="red">BP_1</font> <font color="red">evaluation_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">an_1</font> <font color="red">automatic_1</font> <font color="red">sphygmomanometer_1</font> and a <font color="red">24-h_1</font> <font color="red">ambulatory_1</font> <font color="red">BP_1</font> <font color="red">monitoring_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment . At the end of the study the changes in <font color="red">clinic_1</font> <font color="red">SBP_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">DBP_1</font> were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects . <font color="red">Ambulatory_1</font> <font color="red">SBP_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">DBP_1</font> after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline : deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg ( 95% confidence intervals [ CI ] from -1.9 to + 2.9 mm Hg ) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg ( 95% CI from -2.5 to + 0.3 mm Hg ) . The pattern was similar in the control group . No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes ( angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists ) . Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low - dose aspirin on <font color="red">BP_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> in hypertensives under treatment .
