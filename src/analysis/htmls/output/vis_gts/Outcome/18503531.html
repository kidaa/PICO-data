<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the <font color="red">effectiveness_1</font> of a new multi - component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome ( AS ) : The Junior Detective Training Program . This 7-week program included a computer game , small group sessions , parent training sessions and teacher handouts . 
<br> METHOD Forty - nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention ( n = 26 ) or wait - list control ( n = 23 ) conditions . 
<br> RESULTS Relative to children in the wait - list group , program participants showed greater improvements in <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> over the course of the intervention , as indicated by parent - report measures . Teacher - report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">functioning_1</font> from pre- to post - treatment . Treatment group participants were better able to <font color="red">suggest_1</font> <font color="red">appropriate_1</font> <font color="red">emotion_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">management_1</font> <font color="red">strategies_1</font> for story characters at post - intervention than at pre - intervention , whereas control participants were not . However , there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on <font color="red">facial_1</font> <font color="red">expression_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">body_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">posture_1</font> <font color="red">recognition_1</font> <font color="red">measures_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Follow - up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post - intervention . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">emotional_1</font> <font color="red">understanding_1</font> of children with AS . Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed .
