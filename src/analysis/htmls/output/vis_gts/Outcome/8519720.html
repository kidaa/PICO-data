<br> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Thoracotomy is associated with pain and compromised pulmonary function . Intercostal nerve blocks ( INB ) and subarachnoid morphine ( SM ) act on different portions of the pain pathway . Each is effective for <font color="red">post_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">thoracotomy_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">relief_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The combination of these two modalities in relieving post - thoracotomy pain and improving postoperative pulmonary function has not been investigated . 
<br> METHODS In a double - blind study , 20 patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy for lung resection were randomized to receive 0.5 mg SM preoperatively and INB with bupivacaine ( INB+ ) prior to wound closure or 0.5 mg SM with INB using saline ( INB- ) . <font color="red">Visual_1</font> <font color="red">analog_1</font> <font color="red">scale_1</font> <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> at rest , with cough , and with movement of the ipsilateral arm , <font color="red">forced_1</font> <font color="red">expiratory_1</font> <font color="red">volume_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">1_1</font> <font color="red">second_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">FEV1_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">forced_1</font> <font color="red">vital_1</font> <font color="red">capacity_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">FVC_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> were measured at 4 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after the operation . <font color="red">Opioid_1</font> <font color="red">use_1</font> was measured during the initial 24 hours after the operation . 
<br> RESULTS At 4 hours , the INB+ group demonstrated better <font color="red">FEV1_1</font> ( 56.6% vs. 40.4% of baseline , P < .05 ) and <font color="red">FVC_1</font> <font color="red">values_1</font> ( 54.6% vs. 39.6% of baseline , P < .05 ) and less resting and cough pain ( P < .05 ) . However , <font color="red">FEV1_1</font> continued to decline in the INB+ group at 24 hours to lower than the INB- group although pain scores were similar beyond 4 hours . <font color="red">Opioid_1</font> <font color="red">usage_1</font> during the first 24 hours was similar ( INB- , 16.7 mg vs. INB+ , 13.2 mg , P = .7 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Although postoperative INB provided modest improvements in <font color="red">pain_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">pulmonary_1</font> <font color="red">function_1</font> when used as an adjuvant to 0.5 mg SM for post - thoracotomy analgesia , the benefits were transient . The authors do not recommend adding INB for patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy who receive 0.5 mg SM .
