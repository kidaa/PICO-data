RESPECT - PTSD : re - engineering systems for the primary care treatment of PTSD , a randomized controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Although collaborative care is effective for treating depression and other mental disorders in primary care , there have been no randomized trials of collaborative care specifically for patients with Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare a collaborative approach , the Three Component Model ( 3CM ) , with usual care for treating PTSD in primary care . 
<br> DESIGN The study was a two - arm , parallel randomized clinical trial . PTSD patients were recruited from five primary care clinics at four Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities and randomized to receive usual care or usual care plus 3CM . Blinded assessors collected data at baseline and 3-month and 6-month follow - up . 
<br> PARTICIPANTS Participants were 195 Veterans . Their average age was 45 years , 91% were male , 58% were white , 40% served in Iraq or Afghanistan , and 42% served in Vietnam . 
<br> INTERVENTION All participants received usual care . Participants assigned to 3CM also received telephone care management . Care managers received supervision from a psychiatrist . 
<br> MAIN MEASURES <font color="red">PTSD_1</font> <font color="red">symptom_1</font> <font color="red">severity_1</font> was the primary outcome . <font color="red">Depression_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">functioning_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">perceived_1</font> <font color="red">quality_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">utilization_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">costs_1</font> were secondary outcomes . 
<br> KEY RESULTS There were no differences between 3CM and usual care in <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> or <font color="red">functioning_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Participants assigned to 3CM were more likely to have a <font color="red">mental_1</font> <font color="red">health_1</font> <font color="red">visit_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">fill_1</font> <font color="red">an_1</font> <font color="red">antidepressant_1</font> <font color="red">prescription_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and have <font color="red">adequate_1</font> <font color="red">antidepressant_1</font> <font color="red">refills_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 3CM participants also had more <font color="red">mental_1</font> <font color="red">health_1</font> <font color="red">visits_1</font> and higher <font color="red">outpatient_1</font> <font color="red">pharmacy_1</font> <font color="red">costs_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the need for careful examination of the way that collaborative care models are implemented for treating PTSD , and for additional supports to encourage primary care providers to manage PTSD .
