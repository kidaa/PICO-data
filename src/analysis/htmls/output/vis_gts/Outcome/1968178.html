<br> Changes in continuously recorded ' Finapres ' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by self - inflation of the cuff or just wearing the inflated cuff were studied . Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in <font color="red">systolic_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> of 13 and 12 mm Hg ( hypertensive and normotensive subjects , respectively ) . Wearing the inflated cuff did not change <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Thus the rise in <font color="red">pressure_1</font> was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation . <font color="red">Systolic_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation . Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10 - 15 s when following recommended procedures , <font color="red">self_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">recorded_1</font> <font color="red">systolic_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast .
