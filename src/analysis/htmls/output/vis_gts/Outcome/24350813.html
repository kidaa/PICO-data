An open - label extension study of the <font color="red">safety_1</font> and <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of risperidone in children and adolescents with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the <font color="red">long_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">term_1</font> <font color="red">safety_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in children and adolescents with autistic disorders . 
<br> METHODS In this 6 month ( 26 week ) open - label extension ( OLE ) study , patients ( 5 - 17 years of age , who completed the previous fixed - dose , 6 week , double - blind [ DB ] phase ) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight . The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg / day for those weighing 20 to < 45 kg , and 1.75 mg / day for those weighing ≥ 45 kg . The study primarily assessed risperidone 's <font color="red">safety_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> was assessed as a secondary end - point . 
<br> RESULTS Fifty - six ( 71% ) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE ; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response ( 7 [ 9% ] ) or <font color="red">adverse_1</font> <font color="red">events_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">AE_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> ( 5 [ 6% ] ) . The most common ( ≥ 5% frequency in the total group ) AEs were increased <font color="red">appetite_1</font> ( 11% [ n=9 ] ) ; increased <font color="red">weight_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">vomiting_1</font> ( 9% [ n=7 ] each ) ; <font color="red">sedation_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">pyrexia_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">upper_1</font> <font color="red">respiratory_1</font> <font color="red">tract_1</font> <font color="red">infection_1</font> ( 8% [ n=6 ] each ) ; <font color="red">nasopharyngitis_1</font> ( 6% [ n=5 ] ) ; and <font color="red">somnolence_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">fatigue_1</font> ( 5% [ n=4 ] each ) . <font color="red">Extrapyramidal_1</font> <font color="red">AEs_1</font> were reported in 6 ( 8% ) patients . Increase in <font color="red">mean_1</font> <font color="red">weight_1</font> ( 11 - 15% ) and <font color="red">body_1</font> <font color="red">mass_1</font> <font color="red">index_1</font> ( 5 - 10% ) occurred ; one patient discontinued because of <font color="red">weight_1</font> increase . One potentially <font color="red">prolactin_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">related_1</font> <font color="red">AE_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">irregular_1</font> <font color="red">menstruation_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> was reported . The risperidone high - dose group had the greatest mean improvement in <font color="red">sleep_1</font> <font color="red">visual_1</font> <font color="red">analog_1</font> <font color="red">scale_1</font> ( 24.6 ) . All groups showed additional improvement in <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> <font color="red">scale_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> during the OLE . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS During this OLE , safety findings with risperidone treatment ( maximum weight - based dose of 1.25 mg / day or 1.75 mg / day ) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase , and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic , psychiatric , and behavioral disorders . Patients experienced some additional improvement in <font color="red">irritability_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">related_1</font> <font color="red">behaviors_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
