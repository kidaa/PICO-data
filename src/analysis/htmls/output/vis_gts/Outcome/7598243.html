The <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of prophylactic ondansetron , droperidol , perphenazine , and metoclopramide in the prevention of <font color="red">nausea_1</font> and <font color="red">vomiting_1</font> after major gynecologic surgery . 
<br>
<br> The <font color="red">prophylactic_1</font> <font color="red">antiemetic_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of intravenous ( i.v . ) ondansetron , droperidol , perphenazine , and metoclopramide was evaluated in a prospective , double - blind study of 360 ASA physical status I - III patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy ( TAH ) . Subjects were randomized to receive i.v . , one of ondansetron 4 mg , droperidol 1.25 mg , perphenazine 5 mg , metoclopramide 10 mg , or placebo prior to induction of anesthesia . <font color="red">Hypotension_1</font> immediately after administration of metoclopramide was observed in two patients and four patients given ondansetron developed <font color="red">profound_1</font> <font color="red">systolic_1</font> <font color="red">hypotension_1</font> at induction of anesthesia . Twenty - two percent of patients receiving droperidol became <font color="red">sedated_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Postoperatively , patients developing <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">nausea_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">retching_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> or <font color="red">vomiting_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> defined as <font color="red">severe_1</font> <font color="red">emetic_1</font> <font color="red">sequelae_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">SES_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> were deemed to have failed antiemetic prophylaxis and received antiemetic rescue . A significantly larger number of patients who received i.v . ondansetron ( 63% ) , droperidol ( 76% ) , and perphenazine ( 70% ) were free of <font color="red">SES_1</font> when compared to placebo ( 43% ) ; P < 0.05 . Metoclopramide was ineffective . Although ondansetron , droperidol , and perphenazine were effective in providing <font color="red">antiemetic_1</font> <font color="red">prophylaxis_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> only i.v . perphenazine was free of <font color="red">side_1</font> <font color="red">effects_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Hence , we conclude that perphenazine is the best choice for <font color="red">antiemetic_1</font> <font color="red">prophylaxis_1</font> after TAH .
