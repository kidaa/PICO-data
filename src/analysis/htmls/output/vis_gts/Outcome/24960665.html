<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The choice of a molecular test for first intention determination of <font color="red">paternal_1</font> <font color="red">RHD_1</font> <font color="red">zygosity_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> before entering into invasive diagnostics , is important for the management of pregnancies at risk of haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn related to anti - RhD. 
<br> MATERIALS AND METHODS <font color="red">RHD_1</font> <font color="red">zygosity_1</font> was evaluated in 370 RH:1 Tunisian donors by polymerase chain reaction - sequence - specific polymorphism ( PCR - SSP ) analysis and polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR - RFLP ) amplification of hybrid Rhesus box and by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RQ - PCR ) specific for RHD exon 5 . To evaluate the accuracy of molecular tests in the cases of discordant results , the ten exons of RHD and Rhesus boxes were amplified by PCR and sequenced . 
<br> RESULTS Molecular investigations revealed that our 370 donors comprise 193 dizygous and 145 hemizygous individuals and 32 subjects whose zygosity remains unknown . Positive predictive values were higher than 99% for all the methods , reaching 100% for RQ - PCR . Negative predictive values were 83.24% , 87.27% and 98% for PCR - SSP , PCR - RFLP and RQ - PCR respectively . This study also revealed 19 novel Rhesus box polymorphisms and three novel RHD alleles : RHD(Trp185Stop ) , RHD(Ala176Thr ) and RHD(Ile342Ile ) . 
<br> DISCUSSION RQ - PCR is the most convenient method for first intention determination of <font color="red">paternal_1</font> <font color="red">RHD_1</font> <font color="red">zygosity_1</font> in Tunisians . However , taking into account positive and negative predictive values , PCR - RFLP could be an alternative despite the heterogeneity of Rhesus boxes and the complexity of RHD .
