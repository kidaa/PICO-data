Cryoprobe biopsy increases the <font color="red">diagnostic_1</font> <font color="red">yield_1</font> in endobronchial tumor lesions . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE Forceps biopsy is the standard method to obtain specimens in endoscopically visible lesions . It is common to combine forceps biopsy with cytology methods to increase the diagnostic yield . Although the flexible cryoprobe has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis , the obtained biopsies , called " cryobiopsies , " have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients . The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy . 
<br> METHODS During a 6-year period , 296 patients with visible endoluminal tumor lesions were included in the study at the bronchoscopy unit of a university hospital . In the first consecutively conducted 55 cases , both techniques , forceps biopsy and cryobiopsy , were applied simultaneously . Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens . We evaluated the <font color="red">safety_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">diagnostic_1</font> <font color="red">yield_1</font> to describe the feasibility of cryobiopsy . 
<br> RESULTS Comparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher <font color="red">diagnostic_2</font> <font color="red">yield_2</font> for <font color="red">cryobiopsy_1</font> compared with forceps biopsy ( 89.1% vs 65.5% , P < .05 ) . In this cohort , quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger <font color="red">biopsies_1</font> <font color="red">regarding_1</font> <font color="red">size_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">artifact_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">tissue_1</font> <font color="red">sections_1</font> for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy ( P < .0001 ) . The overall <font color="red">diagnostic_2</font> <font color="red">yield_2</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">cryobiopsy_1</font> was 89.5% . <font color="red">Mild_3</font> <font color="red">bleeding_4</font> occurred in 11 cases ( 3.7% ) , <font color="red">moderate_2</font> <font color="red">bleeding_2</font> occurred in 3 cases ( 1.0% ) , and <font color="red">severe_2</font> <font color="red">bleeding_2</font> occurred in 1 case ( 0.3% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Cryobiopsy is <font color="red">safe_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">increases_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">diagnostic_1</font> <font color="red">yield_1</font> in endobronchial tumor lesions . The method also is <font color="red">feasible_1</font> under routine conditions .
