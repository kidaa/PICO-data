Effect of different rates of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia in elderly patients . 
<br>
<br> The effect of changing the rate of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia was studied in 60 elderly patients . Propofol was administered at 300 , 600 or 1200 ml h-1 until loss of consciousness ( as judged by loss of verbal contact with the patient ) had been achieved . The <font color="red">duration_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">induction_1</font> was significantly longer ( P less than 0.001 ) with the slower infusion rates ( 104 , 68 and 51 s ) , but the <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">used_1</font> was significantly less ( P less than 0.001 ) in these patients ( 1.2 , 1.6 and 2.5 mg kg-1 , respectively ) . The decrease in <font color="red">systolic_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">diastolic_1</font> <font color="red">arterial_1</font> <font color="red">pressure_1</font> was significantly less in the 300-ml h-1 group at the end of induction and immediately after induction ( P less than 0.01 ) . The incidence of <font color="red">apnoea_1</font> was also significantly less in the slower infusion group .
