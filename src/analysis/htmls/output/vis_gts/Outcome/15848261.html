<br> AIMS To <font color="red">compare_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> in post - acute hemiparetic patients , <font color="red">gait_3</font> <font color="red">improvement_3</font> after conventional physical therapy alone or with a specialised balance retraining program . 
<br> PATIENTS Twenty - six patients within 3 months of onset of stroke were randomised to receive physical therapy ( control group ) or therapy and retraining ( experimental group ) , most of the patients in both groups with left hemiplegia . The experimental group was significantly older than the control group . 
<br> METHOD Thirteen patients received early conventional therapy , and 13 received therapy combined with standing balance training by biofeedback ( BPM Monitor ) . <font color="red">Clinical_2</font> <font color="red">measures_2</font> were collected at entry ( J0 ) , once when subjects began to <font color="red">walk_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">JM_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and 30 days later ( JM + 30 ) . <font color="red">Gait_4</font> <font color="red">spatiotemporal_4</font> <font color="red">parameters_4</font> were collected by use of the <font color="red">Vicon_1</font> <font color="red">system_1</font> at JM and JM + 30 . 
<br> RESULTS Whatever the method of rehabilitation , the <font color="red">clinical_2</font> <font color="red">scores_2</font> improved significantly between J0 and JM + 30 , except for <font color="red">spasticity_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The time between stroke and the <font color="red">beginning_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">walking_1</font> was not significantly different between both groups . <font color="red">Gait_4</font> <font color="red">velocity_4</font> increased significantly between JM and JM + 30 in both groups , with no difference between groups . <font color="red">The_1</font> <font color="red">walking_3</font> <font color="red">pattern_3</font> was improved for both groups , with a significant increase of the duration of the <font color="red">paretic_1</font> <font color="red">limb_1</font> <font color="red">single_1</font> <font color="red">stance_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The experimental group significantly improved <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">duration_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">reception_2</font> <font color="red">double_3</font> <font color="red">stance_3</font> <font color="red">on_3</font> <font color="red">the_3</font> <font color="red">paretic_3</font> <font color="red">limb_3</font> between JM and JM + 30 compared with the control group ( P = 0.03 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Both groups demonstrated improvement in the rehabilitation unit . The benefits of visual biofeedback by forceplate system training suggest particular <font color="red">improvement_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">anticipation_2</font> <font color="red">equilibrium_2</font> with conventional therapy .
