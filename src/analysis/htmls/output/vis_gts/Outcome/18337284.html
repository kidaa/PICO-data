Once - daily amoxicillin versus twice - daily penicillin V in group A beta - haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta - haemolytic streptococcal ( GABHS ) pharyngitis . 
<br> OBJECTIVE To test the <font color="red">non_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">inferiority_1</font> of once - daily ( QD ) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice - daily ( BID ) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis . 
<br> METHODS This was a randomised <font color="red">non_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">inferiority_1</font> trial carried out in a school - based clinic in New Zealand . Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD ( or 750 mg if bodyweight was < or=30 kg ) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID ( or 250 mg if bodyweight was < or=20 kg ) for 10 days . Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence . 
<br> OUTCOME <font color="red">Eradication_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">GABHS_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> determined with follow - up throat cultures on days 3 - 6 , 12 - 16 and 26 - 36 . GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish <font color="red">bacteriological_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">failures_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">relapses_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> from new acquisitions . <font color="red">Non_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">inferiority_1</font> was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit ( CL ) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of < or=10% . 
<br> RESULTS 353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin ( n = 177 ) or penicillin V ( n = 176 ) . The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9% at days 3 - 6 , 6.5% at days 12 - 16 and 8.5% at days 26 - 36 . <font color="red">Treatment_1</font> <font color="red">failures_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">including_1</font> <font color="red">relapses_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> occurred at each visit in 5.8% , 12.7% and 10.7% of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2% , 11.9% and 11.3% of penicillin V recipients , respectively . No significant differences in <font color="red">resolution_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> were noted between treatment groups . One case of <font color="red">unsubstantiated_1</font> <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">rheumatic_1</font> <font color="red">fever_1</font> occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin . 
<br> CONCLUSION In this adequately powered study , once - daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice - daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis .
