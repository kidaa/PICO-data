Since this new technique is based solely upon exhalation , anomalies associated with inspiration and breath holding do not affect results . Additionally , because prolonged breath holding is not required , measurements can readily be made in dyspnoeic patients .

Patients did not practise the exhalation manoeuvre prior to testing . 
<br> RESULTS The comparative results were very close ; mean difference ( bias ) + /- standard deviation ( precision ) was 0.05 ( 0.84 ) mmol / min / kPa . The relation was equally strong in patients with severe pulmonary disease ; for patients with FEV1 < 1.51 the mean difference was 0.21 ( 0.80 ) mmol / min / kPa . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Since the results were essentially identical between the techniques , it seems that comparable pathophysiological factors affect TLCO during breath holding and constant exhalation . Constant exhalation may therefore be a useful alternative to the breath holding technique for clinical measurement of TLCO .
