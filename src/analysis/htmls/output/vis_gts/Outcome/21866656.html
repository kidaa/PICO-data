[ Clinical study on treatment of endometriosis - related infertility patients by laparoscopic surgery in combination of quyu jiedu recipe ] . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To study the <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of the laparoscopic surgery in combination of Quyu Jiedu Recipe ( QYJDR ) on endometriosis ( EMs)-related infertility patients . 
<br> METHODS 130 EMs - related infertility patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to two groups , i.e. , the test group ( 75 cases ) and the control group ( 55 cases ) . All patients received routine progesterone treatment after laparoscopic surgery . QYJDR was given to patients in the test group after laparoscopic surgery , lasting for twelve months . The <font color="red">pregnancy_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups . The <font color="red">Chinese_1</font> <font color="red">medicine_1</font> <font color="red">syndrome_1</font> <font color="red">integrals_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">endometrium_1</font> <font color="red">antibody_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">EMAb_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">antigen_1</font> <font color="red">125_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CA125_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy . 
<br> RESULTS The <font color="red">pregnancy_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the test group than in the control group [ 61.33% ( 46/75 ) vs 45.45% ( 25/55 ) ] , showing significant difference ( P<0.05 ) . The <font color="red">Chinese_1</font> <font color="red">medicine_1</font> <font color="red">syndrome_1</font> <font color="red">integral_1</font> was ( 16.07 + /- 6.77 ) score and ( 7.25 + /- 3.27 ) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the test group , while it was ( 15.92 + /- 7.51 ) score and ( 12.73 + /- 6.12 ) score in the control group . The <font color="red">Chinese_1</font> <font color="red">medicine_1</font> <font color="red">syndrome_1</font> <font color="red">integral_1</font> after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group . Besides , the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [ ( 9.12 + /- 6.16 ) score vs ( 3.48 + /- 2.06 ) score ) ] , showing statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . After three - month drug therapy , the <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">EMAb_1</font> <font color="red">negative_1</font> <font color="red">conversion_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group ( 44.44% vs 15.62% ) , showing statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . The <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">CA125_1</font> <font color="red">level_1</font> was ( 31.88 + /- 15.78 ) U / mL before drug therapy and ( 18.82 + /- 10.08 ) U / mL three months after drug therapy in the test group , while it was ( 30.63 + /- 19.28 ) U / mL and ( 18.05 + /- 11.20 ) U / mL respectively in the control group . It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy ( P>0.05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">stasis_1</font> and <font color="red">toxin_1</font> <font color="red">accumulation_1</font> <font color="red">syndrome_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> promote <font color="red">negative_1</font> <font color="red">conversion_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">EMAb_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> lower <font color="red">serum_1</font> <font color="red">CA125_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and elevate the <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">pregnancy_1</font> <font color="red">rate_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of <font color="red">EMs_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">related_1</font> <font color="red">infertility_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
