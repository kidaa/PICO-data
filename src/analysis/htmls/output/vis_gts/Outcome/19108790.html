<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of <font color="red">postoperative_2</font> <font color="red">nausea_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">vomiting_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">PONV_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> . Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy ( with axillary dissection ) experience <font color="red">PONV_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg / kg was more effective than placebo in preventing <font color="red">PONV_1</font> in women who undergo mastectomy . 
<br> OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the <font color="red">efficacy_1</font> of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of <font color="red">PONV_2</font> after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients . 
<br> METHODS In this prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg / kg , droperidol 20 microg / kg , metoclopramide 0.2 mg / kg , or placebo ( isotonic saline ) immediately after skin suture . A standard general anesthetic technique , including sevoflurane and air in oxygen , was used . All episodes of <font color="red">PONV_1</font> during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment . The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced <font color="red">extrapyramidal_2</font> <font color="red">symptoms_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> To maintain the integrity of the study results , none of the patients received preanesthetic medication . 
<br> RESULTS A total of 100 women ( mean [ SD ] age , 52 [ 7 ] years ; height , 154 [ 6 ] cm ; weight , 54 [ 7 ] kg ) were included in the study . Each study group comprised 25 patients . There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient <font color="red">demographics_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">type_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">awakening_1</font> <font color="red">time_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The prevalences of <font color="red">PONV_1</font> 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with propofol ( P = 0.005 ) , 32% with droperidol ( P = 0.011 ) , and 60% with metoclopramide ( P = NS ) , compared with placebo ( 68% ) . No significant difference in the prevalence of <font color="red">PONV_1</font> was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol , and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of <font color="red">PONV_2</font> compared with metoclopramide ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.043 , respectively ) . <font color="red">Extrapyramidal_2</font> <font color="red">symptoms_2</font> were not reported in any of the groups . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The prevalences of <font color="red">PONV_1</font> were not significantly different between propofol 0.5 mg / kg and droperidol 20 microg / kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small , select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery . The prevalences of <font color="red">PONV_2</font> were significantly lower with propofol and droperidol compared with metoclopramide 0.2 mg / kg and placebo .
