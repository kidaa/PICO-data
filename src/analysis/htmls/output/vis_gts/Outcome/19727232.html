<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To explore the <font color="red">short_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">term_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">effect_1</font> of the auditory integrative training on autistic children and provide them with clinical support for rehabilitative treatment . 
<br> METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used . They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one , and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies . The patients were investigated using <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">manifestation_1</font> and <font color="red">Autism_1</font> <font color="red">Behavior_1</font> <font color="red">Checklist_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ABC_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> and <font color="red">intelligence_1</font> <font color="red">quotient_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">IQ_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> before and after six months of treatment . The effect was evaluated through the <font color="red">changes_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">clinical_1</font> <font color="red">manifestations_1</font> and scores of <font color="red">ABC_1</font> and <font color="red">IQ_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The changes of scores of <font color="red">IQ_1</font> were determined with <font color="red">Gesell_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">WPPSI_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">WISC_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">R._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training , 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects , such as the <font color="red">disorders_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">their_1</font> <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">interactions_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">typical_1</font> <font color="red">behavior_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> while they had not changed in their <font color="red">abnormal_1</font> <font color="red">behaviors_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The scores of <font color="red">IQ_1</font> or <font color="red">DQ_1</font> had increased and scores of <font color="red">ABC_1</font> had dropped . The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics ( P < 0.01 ) . The decreasing level of both <font color="red">ABC_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> and the increasing level of the <font color="red">IQ_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> were negatively correlated with age , and the decreasing level of <font color="red">ABC_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> was in line regression(positive correlation ) with base <font color="red">IQ_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSION The treatment of auditory integrative training ( AIT ) could greatly improve on <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">disorders_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the <font color="red">difficulties_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">social_1</font> <font color="red">interactions_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">typical_1</font> <font color="red">behavior_1</font> <font color="red">symptoms_1</font> and <font color="red">developmental_1</font> <font color="red">levels_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short - term treatment effect .
