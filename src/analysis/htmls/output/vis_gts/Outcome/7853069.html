<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To consider the <font color="red">impact_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">primary_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">patient_1</font> <font color="red">outcomes_1</font> of using both a screener to determine elevated anxiety levels among patients with previously undetected anxiety and a physician intervention to inform physicians of their patients ' conditions . 
<br> DESIGN Participating physicians were randomized to either the demonstration or the control arm , and patients were assigned to a study arm based on the randomization of their physicians . The patients were followed for change in outcome measures during the five - month study period . 
<br> SETTING A mixed - model health maintenance organization serving approximately 110,000 enrollees in central Colorado . 
<br> PATIENTS / PARTICIPANTS 573 patients who had unrecognized and untreated anxiety identified from the approximately 8,000 patients who completed the waiting room screening questionnaire . 
<br> INTERVENTIONS A physician intervention served the dual function of 1 ) providing an educational demonstration of anxiety in the primary care setting and 2 ) providing a reporting system for summarizing the anxiety symptom levels and functioning status of the patients enrolled in the study . 
<br> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient outcomes were measured as changes in <font color="red">global_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> <font color="red">scores_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">functioning_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">well_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">being_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">'_1</font> <font color="red">reports_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">global_1</font> <font color="red">improvements_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that this method of reporting symptoms and functioning status to primary care physicians did not significantly change patient outcomes . Improvement in outcomes appeared to be more closely associated with the patient 's severity of psychological distress .
