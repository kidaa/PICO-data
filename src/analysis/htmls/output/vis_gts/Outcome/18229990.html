<font color="red">Language_1</font> <font color="red">outcome_1</font> in autism : randomized comparison of joint attention and play interventions . 
<br>
<br> This study reports results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at joint attention ( JA ) and symbolic play ( SP ) in preschool children with autism , with prediction to <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">outcome_1</font> 12 months later . Participants were 58 children ( 46 boys ) with autism between 3 and 4 years of age . Children were randomized to a JA intervention , an SP intervention , or control group . Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5 - 6 weeks . <font color="red">Assessments_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">JA_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">SP_1</font> <font color="red">skills_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">mother_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">child_1</font> <font color="red">interactions_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">development_1</font> were collected at 4 time points : pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers . Results indicate that <font color="red">expressive_1</font> <font color="red">language_1</font> gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group , and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated . For children beginning treatment with the lowest language levels , the JA intervention improved <font color="red">language_1</font> <font color="red">outcome_1</font> significantly more than did the SP or control interventions . These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating JA and SP skills in young children with autism .
