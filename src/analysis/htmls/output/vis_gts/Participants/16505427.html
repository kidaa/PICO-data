Phase III study of two different dosing schedules of erythropoietin in <font color="red">anemic_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare maintenance epoetin alfa administered once every 3 weeks with continued weekly epoetin alfa for <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">associated_2</font> <font color="red">anemia_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously ( SC ) , followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa ( 40 K arm ) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa ( 120 K arm ) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Three_2</font> <font color="red">hundred_2</font> <font color="red">sixty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">five_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">were_2</font> <font color="red">enrolled_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> One hundred eighty - three patients were assigned to the 40 K arm , and 182 were assigned to the 120 K arm . There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study ( 23% in 40 K arm and 18% in 120 K arm , P = .22 ) or specifically during the maintenance phase ( 13% in 40 K arm v 15% in 120 K arm , P = .58 ) . Patients randomly assigned to the 40 K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g / dL hemoglobin ( Hb ) increment , were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb , and had higher mean end - of - study Hb levels . Toxicities , including thromboembolism , and overall survival were similar . Patients in the 40 K arm had a higher global quality of life ( QOL ) at baseline for unclear reasons , whereas patients in the 120 K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study , so end - of - study QOL was equivalent . 
<br> CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U , a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing transfusion needs or sacrificing QOL . The Hb increment is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa . Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results .
