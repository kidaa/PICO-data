<br> A series of randomized , controlled , masked field studies was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of selamectin in the treatment of flea infestations on <font color="red">dogs_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">cats_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and in the prevention of heartworm infection in <font color="red">dogs_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In addition , observations were made on the beneficial effect of selamectin treatment on <font color="red">dogs_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">cats_1</font> <font color="red">showing_1</font> <font color="red">signs_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">allergy_1</font> <font color="red">dermatitis_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">FAD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In all studies selamectin was applied topically , once per month , in unit doses providing a minimum dosage of 6mgkg(-1 ) . <font color="red">Dogs_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">cats_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">naturally_1</font> <font color="red">occurring_1</font> <font color="red">flea_1</font> <font color="red">infestations_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">some_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">which_1</font> <font color="red">also_1</font> <font color="red">had_1</font> <font color="red">signs_1</font> <font color="red">associated_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">FAD_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> were assigned randomly to receive three months of topical treatment with selamectin ( 220 dogs , 189 cats ) or a positive - control product ( dogs : fenthion , n=81 ; cats : pyrethrins , n=66 ) . Selamectin was administered on days 0 , 30 , and 60 . Day 0 was defined as the day that the animal first received treatment . Flea burdens were assessed by flea comb counts and clinical evaluations of FAD were performed before treatment , and on days 14 , 30 , 60 , and 90 . On days 30 , 60 , and 90 , mean flea counts in selamectin - treated dogs were reduced by 92.1 , 99.0 , and 99.8% , and mean flea counts in fenthion - treated dogs were reduced by 81.5 , 86.8 , and 86.1% , respectively , compared with day 0 counts . Also , on days 30 , 60 , and 90 , mean flea counts in selamectin - treated cats were reduced by 92.5 , 98.3 , and 99.3% , and mean flea counts in pyrethrin - treated cats were reduced by 66.4 , 73.9 , and 81.3% , respectively , compared with day 0 counts . Selamectin also was beneficial in alleviating signs in dogs and cats diagnosed clinically with FAD .

Selamectin achieved a heartworm prevention rate of 100% , with all dogs testing negative for microfilariae and adult heartworm antigen on days 180 and 300 .

Results of these studies indicated that selamectin was highly effective in the control of flea infestations in <font color="red">dogs_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">cats_1</font> without the need for simultaneous treatment of the environment or of in - contact animals and also was beneficial in alleviating signs associated with FAD . Selamectin also was 100% effective in preventing the development of canine heartworms and was safe for topical use in <font color="red">dogs_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">cats_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
