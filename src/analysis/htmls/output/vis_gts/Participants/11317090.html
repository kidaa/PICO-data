<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation aquatic exercise classes from the societal perspective . 
<br> DESIGN Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes . Cost per quality - adjusted life year ( QALY ) gained was estimated using trial data . Sample size was based on 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost / QALY gained would not exceed $ 50,000 . 
<br> SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited <font color="red">249_1</font> <font color="red">adults_1</font> <font color="red">from_1</font> <font color="red">Washington_1</font> <font color="red">State_1</font> <font color="red">aged_1</font> <font color="red">55_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">75_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">a_1</font> <font color="red">doctor_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">confirmed_1</font> <font color="red">diagnosis_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">osteoarthritis_1</font> to participate in aquatic classes . The Quality of Well - Being Scale ( QWB ) and Current Health Desirability Rating ( CHDR ) were used for economic evaluation , supplemented by the arthritis - specific Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale ( CES - D ) , and Perceived Quality of Life Scale ( PQOL ) collected at baseline and postclass . Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs . Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries / questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs . Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs / QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates . 
<br> RESULTS Aquatic exercisers reported equal ( QWB ) or better ( CHDR , HAQ , PQOL ) health - related quality of life compared with controls . Outcomes improved with regular class attendance . Costs / QALY gained discounted at 3% were $ 205,186 using the QWB and $ 32,643 using the CHRD . 
<br> CONCLUSION Aquatic exercise exceeded $ 50,000 per QALY gained using the community - weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant - weighted measure . Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise .
