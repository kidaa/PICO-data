The effect of four different irrigation systems in the removal of a root canal sealer . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of sonic , ultrasonic , and hydrodynamic devices in the removal of a root canal sealer from the surface and from simulated irregularities of <font color="red">root_1</font> <font color="red">canals_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>

Compared were the effects of ( control ) syringe irrigation , ( 1 ) CanalBrush , ( 2 ) passive ultrasonic irrigation , ( 3 ) EndoActivator , and ( 4 ) RinsEndo on the removal of the sealer . The specimens were divided into four groups ( N   =   12 ) and one control group ( N   =   5 ) via randomization . The amount of remaining sealer in the root canal irregularities was evaluated under a microscope using a 4-grade scoring system , whereas the remaining sealer on the root canal surface was evaluated with a 7-grade scoring system . 
<br> RESULTS Passive ultrasonic irrigation is more effective than the other tested irrigation systems or syringe irrigation in removing sealer from root canal walls ( p   <   0.01 ) . None of the techniques had a significant effect on cleaning the lateral grooves . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of this study protocol ultrasonic irrigation shows a superior effect on sealer removal from the root canal surface during endodontic retreatment . Cleaning of lateral grooves seems not to be possible with one of the techniques investigated . 
<br> CLINICAL RELEVANCE Incomplete removal of root canal sealer during re - treatment may cause treatment failure . Passive Ultrasonic irrigation seems to be the most effective system to remove sealer from a <font color="red">root_1</font> <font color="red">canal_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
