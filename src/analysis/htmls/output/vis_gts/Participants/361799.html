[ The chemotherapy of <font color="red">advanced_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">._1</font> A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study ( 1974 - 1977 ) ( author 's transl ) ] . 
<br>
<br> The authors explain the objectives and the structure of a programme evolved for the methodic study of <font color="red">advanced_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancers_2</font> which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the <font color="red">departments_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">medicine_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">eight_1</font> <font color="red">French_1</font> <font color="red">anticancer_1</font> <font color="red">centres_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> They analyse the initial phases , which correspond to the three first years of work . They give the state of the results that have been obtained in <font color="red">603_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> using three protocols for treatment . These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of chemotherapy which consisted of vincristine associated for the one part with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluoro - uracil and on the other hand with doxorubicine or / and with methotrexate . From this study there emerged the value of combined therapy using doxorubicine as much because of the frequency with which results better than 50% were obtained ( in a randomised trial ) as by their quality , which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases . They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all complex therapy which aims as much at palliation as at cure , and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an anticancer therapy .
