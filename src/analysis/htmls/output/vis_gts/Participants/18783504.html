<br>
<br> AIM The study aimed to test simultaneously our understanding of the effects of bupropion sustained - release ( SR ) treatment on putative mediators and our understanding of determinants of post - quit abstinence , including withdrawal distress , cigarette craving , positive affect and subjective reactions to cigarettes smoked during a lapse . The specificity of bupropion SR effects was also tested in exploratory analyses . 
<br> DESIGN Data from a randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial of bupropion SR were submitted to mediation analyses .

<br> INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill and to receive eight brief individual counseling sessions or no counseling . 
<br> MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post - quit . 
<br> FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short - term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette , but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect . Bupropion SR effects on point - prevalence abstinence at 1 month post - quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self - efficacy . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of bupropion SR treatment and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy .
