<br> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The pain in <font color="red">sickle_2</font> <font color="red">cell_2</font> <font color="red">anemia_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">SCA_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> is often triggered by dehydration , acidosis , and fever that are usually due to malaria . Intake of lime juice was recently demonstrated to facilitate clearance of the malaria parasite . It was therefore sought to determine whether regular intake of lime juice will ameliorate crisis , especially recurrent bone pain . 
<br> DESIGN In this preliminary , open - labeled , randomized study , the effects of lime juice on the clinical and some laboratory characteristics of <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">SCA_2</font> were tested . 
<br> RESULTS Among the <font color="red">113_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">SCA_2</font> <font color="red">studied_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">two_1</font> <font color="red">hospitals_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the 58 receiving lime treatment had lower rates of significant painful episodes than the 55 without lime ( 37 versus 83 crises in 6 months , and 0.64±0.11 versus 1.51±0.34 average rates per child , p<0.001 ) . Also , fewer subjects than the controls had significant painful episodes ( 50.0% versus 92.7% ) ; febrile illness ( 46.6% versus 87.3% ) and admission rate ( 3.4% versus 34.5% ) ( p<0.001 ) . The mean hematocrit of the subjects ( 26.23±2.03% ) at the end of the study was also higher , p<0.001 . However , transfusion rate , presence of hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , and jaundice was similar . Treatment with lime did not cause any significant side - effect . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Regular intake of lime juice may be of great therapeutic and nutritional relevance in <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">SCA_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
