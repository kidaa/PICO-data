<br>
<br> To verify the efficacy and the tolerability of local immunotherapy ( LI ) by inhalation of a powder extract of house dust mite ( HDM ) , in comparison with parenteral immunotherapy ( PI ) by injection , <font color="red">10_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">asthma_2</font> <font color="red">due_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">HDM_2</font> were studied in a blind fashion . 5 patients ( Group A ) underwent LI and subcutaneous injections of placebo , 5 patients ( Group B ) underwent PI and inhalation of lactose for 6 months . In both groups each inhalation was preceded by premedication with disodium cromoglycate ( DSCG ) ( 40 mg ) . In Group A a significant decrease in symptoms score and in peak expiratory flow ( PEF)-derived parameters was observed already after 3 months of treatment , and 2 patients lost the late component of the bronchial response to the challenge with HDM . No significant variation was found in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water ( UNDW ) and in immunologic humoral and cellular parameters in peripheral blood after treatment in either group . No local important adverse reactions were observed in Group A and no systemic side effects were observed in either group . We conclude that LI is as effective as PI , but more rapid in its action , in the treatment of <font color="red">asthma_2</font> <font color="red">due_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">HDM_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Moreover , LI is locally well tolerated , providing DSCG is inhaled before each therapeutic inhalation , and does not induce systemic side effects .
