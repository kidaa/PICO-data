<br> BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia , where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described . These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes . Epigastric impedance is a non - invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity . At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia , measured with epigastric impedance , has been presented , and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of impedance gastrography in control infants , compared to <font color="red">infants_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">different_1</font> <font color="red">gastrointestinal_1</font> <font color="red">diseases_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> before and after treatment of their disease .

All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour . The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible . 
<br> RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients . A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients , high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients . Short - term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants ( 32.5% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Using epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity , which was not found in the control infants . The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown , but they may be related to electrical control activity .
