<br>
<br> The effects of 12 weeks of antioxidant supplementation on exercise - induced oxidative stress were investigated in <font color="red">older_2</font> <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">60_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">SE_2</font> <font color="red">1_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">;_2</font> <font color="red">BMI_2</font> <font color="red">26_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">SE_2</font> <font color="red">1_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">kg_2</font> <font color="red">/_2</font> <font color="red">m(2_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Subjects were randomly divided in two groups : supplementation ( n 11 ) with 100 mg dl - alpha - tocopheryl acetate , 200 mg ascorbic acid , and 2 mg beta - carotene , and placebo ( n 9 ) . Before and after the 12 week supplementation period , subjects cycled for 45 min at submaximal intensity ( 50 % maximal workload capacity ) . Antipyrine was used as marker for oxidative stress . Antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals to form para- and ortho - hydroxyantipyrine . The latter metabolite is not formed in man through the mono - oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450 . Daily supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of alpha - tocopherol and beta - carotene in the supplemented group ( Delta 14.4 ( SE 3.2 ) and 0.4 ( se 0.1 ) micromol / l ; P<0.001 and P<0.01 ) . No significant differences , within and between groups , were observed in the exercise - induced increase in the ratios para- and ortho - hydroxyantipyrine to antipyrine . In addition , supplementation did not affect the exercise - induced increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in plasma . In conclusion , in <font color="red">60-year_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">old_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> antioxidant supplementation had no effect on the exercise - induced increase in oxidative stress as measured by free radical products of antipyrine .
