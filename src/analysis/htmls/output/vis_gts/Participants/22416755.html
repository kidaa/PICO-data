<br> <font color="red">Children_2</font> acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things , but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired . In this article , it is proposed that <font color="red">children_1</font> acquire generic knowledge by sharing in pretend play . In Experiment 1 , <font color="red">twenty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">two_2</font> <font color="red">3-_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">4-year_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">olds_2</font> watched pretense in which a puppet represented a " nerp " ( an unfamiliar kind of animal ) . For instance , in one scenario , the nerp ate and disliked a carrot . When subsequently asked generic questions about real nerps , children 's responses suggested that they had learned general facts ( e.g. , nerps dislike carrots ) . In Experiment 2 , <font color="red">thirty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">two_2</font> <font color="red">4-_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">5-year_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">olds_2</font> learned from scenarios lacking pretend speech or sound effects . The findings reveal a long overlooked means by which <font color="red">children_2</font> can acquire generic knowledge .
