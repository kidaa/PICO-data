Economic burden of <font color="red">childhood_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">spectrum_2</font> <font color="red">disorders_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To estimate the associations between <font color="red">autism_1</font> <font color="red">spectrum_1</font> <font color="red">disorder_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ASD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">diagnoses_1</font> and service use , caregiver time , and cost outcomes . 
<br> METHODS We used national data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to the National Health Interview Survey and a study - specific survey to estimate the annual utilization and costs for health care , school , <font color="red">ASD_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> related therapy , family - coordinated services , as well as caregiver time in <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">aged_1</font> <font color="red">3_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">17_1</font> <font color="red">years_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">without_1</font> <font color="red">parent_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">reported_1</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Regression analyses estimated the association between <font color="red">ASD_1</font> <font color="red">diagnosis_1</font> and cost , controlling for child gender , age , race / ethnicity , insurance status , household income , country region and urban / rural classification , and non - ASD - related illnesses . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Children_1</font> with parent - reported <font color="red">ASD_1</font> had higher levels of health care office visits and prescription drug use compared with <font color="red">children_1</font> without <font color="red">ASD_1</font> ( P < .05 ) . A greater proportion of <font color="red">children_1</font> in the <font color="red">ASD_1</font> group used special educational services ( 76% vs. 7% in the control group , P < .05 ) . After adjusting for <font color="red">child_1</font> demographic characteristics and non - <font color="red">ASD_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> associated illnesses , <font color="red">ASD_1</font> was associated with $ 3020 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] : $ 1017-$4259 ) higher health care costs and $ 14,061 ( 95% CI : $ 4390-$24,302 ) higher aggregate non - health care costs , including $ 8610 ( 95% CI : $ 6595-$10,421 ) higher school costs . In adjusted analyses , parents who reported that their <font color="red">child_1</font> had <font color="red">ASD_1</font> did not have significantly higher out - of - pocket costs or spend more time on caregiving activities compared with control parents . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The economic burden associated with <font color="red">ASD_2</font> is substantial and can be measured across multiple sectors of our society . Previous analyses that focused on health care underestimated this economic burden , particularly for school systems .
