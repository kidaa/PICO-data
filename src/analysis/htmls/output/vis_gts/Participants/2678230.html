[ The effect of ionic and nonionic x - ray contrast media on myocardial perfusion and <font color="red">myocardial_1</font> <font color="red">function_1</font> <font color="red">]_1</font> . 
<br>
<br> The influence of injections of Amidotrizoate and Iopromide into the left coronary artery on global myocardial perfusion and function ( pressures in the left ventricle , heart rate ) as well as excitation formation and transmission was studied in <font color="red">16_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ischaemic_2</font> <font color="red">heart_2</font> <font color="red">disease_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> No statistically significant differences in myocardial perfusion measured were found with xenon-133 in this small group between rest and dipyridamole load for ionic and non - ionic contrast media .
