<br>
<br> INTRODUCTION There is an increasing amount of evidence showing that physical activity and sun exposure are effective coadjuvant treatments for <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">mild_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">moderate_2</font> <font color="red">depression_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> However , there is a lack of information regarding patient 's adherence to these recommendations in daily clinical practice . 
<br> METHODS We conducted a study including <font color="red">15_2</font> <font color="red">depressive_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">been_2</font> <font color="red">under_2</font> <font color="red">antidepressant_2</font> <font color="red">treatment_2</font> <font color="red">for_2</font> <font color="red">at_2</font> <font color="red">least_2</font> <font color="red">one_2</font> <font color="red">month_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> They wore a wrist - watch - like actimetry sensor to measure physical activity and sun exposure 24 hours a day . After one week of baseline assessment , patients were randomised into one of the two arms of the study . Patients in the experimental group received a brief note in which they were explicitly asked to increase both their physical activity level and time of sun exposure , while control group patients did not receive these explicit recommendations . 
<br> RESULTS One week after recommendations were delivered , only patients in the experimental group had increased time of sun exposure and physical activity ( 25.8% and 14.3% , respectively ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS <font color="red">Depressive_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> are able to follow prescribed lifestyle recommendations in the short - term .
