Safety and preliminary immunogenicity of Cuban pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in <font color="red">healthy_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">:_2</font> a randomized phase I clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> A new heptavalent conjugate vaccine ( PCV7-TT ) is under development in Cuba . PCV7-TT contains 2 μg of serotypes 1 , 5 , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F and 4 μg of 6B , each one conjugated to tetanus toxoid ( TT ) . This vaccine was designed with the serotypes that cause most invasive pneumococcal diseases ( IPD ) worldwide . In the present study , we investigated the safety and explored the immunogenicity of PCV7-TT during a controlled , randomized and double blind clinical trial phase I in <font color="red">4_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">5-year_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">old_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> PCV7-TT was well tolerated and as safe as Synflorix used as control vaccine . Following a single - dose vaccination , all individual serotypes included in PCV7-TT induced statistically significant increase of IgG GMC and OPA GMT . These are the first clinical results of PCV7-TT in <font color="red">children_1</font> and they pave the way toward next clinical trials in <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">infants_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> This clinical trial was published in the Cuban Public Register of Clinical Trials with code RPCEC00000173 .
