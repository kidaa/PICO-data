<br>
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Autistic_2</font> <font color="red">disorder_2</font> is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction , impairments in communication , and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests . Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some <font color="red">persons_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism . 
<br> METHODS <font color="red">Thirty_2</font> <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autistic_2</font> <font color="red">disorder_2</font> completed a 12-week double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate . Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks of treatment . 
<br> RESULTS Eight ( 53% ) of 15 patients in the fluvoxamine - treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the placebo group ( P = .001 ) . Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior ( P < .001 ) , maladaptive behavior ( P < .001 ) , and aggression ( P < .03 ) , and in improving some aspects of social relatedness ( P < .04 ) , especially language usage ( P < .008 ) . Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior , or full - scale IQ . Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients , fluvoxamine was well tolerated . No dyskinesias , adverse cardiovascular events , or seizures occurred . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short - term treatment of the symptoms of <font color="red">autistic_1</font> <font color="red">disorder_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">adults_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism .
