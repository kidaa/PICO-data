<br> BACKGROUND Incidence and severity of herpes zoster ( HZ ) and postherpetic neuralgia increase with age , associated with age - related decrease in immunity to varicella - zoster virus ( VZV ) . One dose of zoster vaccine ( ZV ) has demonstrated substantial protection against HZ ; this study examined impact of a second dose of ZV . 
<br> METHODS Randomized , double - blind , <font color="red">multicenter_1</font> <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">210_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> <font color="red">≥60_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">old_2</font> compared immunity and safety profiles after one and two doses of ZV , separated by 6 weeks , vs. placebo . Immunogenicity was evaluated using VZV interferon - gamma ( IFN-γ ) enzyme - linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay and VZV glycoprotein enzyme - linked immunosorbent antibody ( gpELISA ) assay . Adverse experiences ( AEs ) were recorded on a standardized Vaccination Report Card . 
<br> RESULTS No serious vaccine - related AEs occurred . VZV IFN-γ ELISPOT geometric mean count ( GMC ) of spot - forming cells per 10(6 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased in the ZV group from 16.9 prevaccination to 49.5 and 32.8 at 2 and 6 weeks postdose 1 , respectively . Two weeks , 6 weeks and 6 months postdose 2 , GMC was 44.3 , 42.9 , and 36.5 , respectively . GMC in the placebo group did not change during the study . The peak ELISPOT response occurred ∼2 weeks after each ZV dose . The gpELISA geometric mean titers ( GMTs ) in the ZV group were higher than in the placebo group at 6 weeks after each dose . Correlation between the IFN-γ ELISPOT and gpELISA assays was poor . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS ZV was generally well - tolerated and immunogenic in <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">≥60_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">old_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> A second dose of ZV was generally safe , but did not boost VZV - specific immunity beyond levels achieved postdose 1 .
