In particular , the role of adjunctive nonpharmacologic analgesic techniques is unclear . The authors report a randomized , controlled study of <font color="red">21_2</font> <font color="red">hospitalized_2</font> <font color="red">trauma_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> to assess the analgesic efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis ( VRH)-hypnotic induction and analgesic suggestion delivered by customized virtual reality ( VR ) hardware / software . Subjective pain ratings were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH ( used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care ) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone . VRH patients reported less pain intensity and less pain unpleasantness compared to control groups . These preliminary findings suggest that VRH analgesia is a novel technology worthy of further study , both to improve pain management and to increase availability of hypnotic analgesia to <font color="red">populations_1</font> <font color="red">without_1</font> <font color="red">access_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">therapist_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">provided_1</font> <font color="red">hypnosis_1</font> and suggestion .
