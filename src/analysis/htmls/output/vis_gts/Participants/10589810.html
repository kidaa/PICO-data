<br> Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause - related treatment of periodontal diseases , repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth . In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy , non - root substance removing curettes have been developed . However , the clinical effects of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established . The aims of this study were , therefore , to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic curettes ( Universal Perio Soft Scaler , Hawe - Neos Dental , Bioggio , TI , Switzerland ) versus conventional steel curettes on the periodontal conditions during <font color="red">supportive_1</font> <font color="red">periodontal_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">40_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> <font color="red">participated_1</font> in this parallel , randomized , double blind , prospective longitudinal clinical study following <font color="red">active_1</font> <font color="red">peridontal_1</font> <font color="red">therapy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel curettes during a <font color="red">supportive_1</font> <font color="red">periodontal_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">visit_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">SPT_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The other 20 subjects , the experimental group , were treated using plastic curettes during a similar SPT visit . Clinical parameters , such as bleeding on probing ( BOP ) and probing pocket depth ( PPD ) , were assessed at baseline and 3 - 6 months later at the next regular SPT visit . In addition , the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline . The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time . Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17 - 42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days ( mean BOP baseline : 26% , mean BOP after 10 days : 16% ) . This clinical study suggests that non - root substance removing curettes may be valuable instruments for <font color="red">periodontally_1</font> <font color="red">treated_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> during maintenance care , thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth .
