<br>_1</font> OBJECTIVE To consider the impact on <font color="red">primary_1</font> <font color="red">care_1</font> <font color="red">patient_1</font> outcomes of using both a screener to determine elevated <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> levels among <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">previously_1</font> <font color="red">undetected_1</font> <font color="red">anxiety_1</font> and a physician intervention to inform physicians of their patients ' conditions . 
<br> DESIGN Participating physicians were randomized to either the demonstration or the control arm , and patients were assigned to a study arm based on the randomization of their physicians . The patients were followed for change in outcome measures during the five - month study period . 
<br> SETTING A mixed - model health maintenance organization serving approximately 110,000 enrollees in central Colorado .

<br>_1</font> INTERVENTIONS A physician intervention served the dual function of 1 ) providing an educational demonstration of anxiety in the primary care setting and 2 ) providing a reporting system for summarizing the anxiety symptom levels and functioning status of the patients enrolled in the study . 
<br> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient outcomes were measured as changes in global anxiety scores , functioning and well - being , and patients ' reports of global improvements . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that this method of reporting symptoms and functioning status to primary care physicians did not significantly change patient outcomes . Improvement in outcomes appeared to be more closely associated with the patient 's severity of psychological distress .
