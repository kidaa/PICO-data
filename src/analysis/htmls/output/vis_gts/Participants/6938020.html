EORTC protocols in <font color="red">prostatic_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> An interim report . 
<br>
<br> Two parallel prospective randomized studies have been undertaken by the EORTC Urological Group in <font color="red">previously_2</font> <font color="red">untreated_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">prostatic_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> in order to compare low dose Stilboestrol versus Cyproterone acetate versus Medroxyprogesterone acetate in the first trial , and Stilboestrol versus Estracyt in the second trial . Although the follow up is still short , no superiority of the other drugs over Stilboestrol had appeared so far with regard to either objective response or significant side effects apart from gynaecomastia . In the third trial , <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">advanced_1</font> <font color="red">disease_1</font> <font color="red">no_1</font> <font color="red">longer_1</font> <font color="red">responsive_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">hormonal_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> were randomized to either Adriamycin or Procarbazine . Toxicity and early death were particularly frequent in Procarbazine treated patients , whereas most patients progressed in both treatment groups .
