The control group patients received standard hospital care and follow - up . The project group patients were not admitted if this could be avoided ; instead they were taken back to the community by the project team who provided them and their relatives with comprehensive , assertive and prolonged follow - up treatment backed by a 24-hour crisis service . The majority ( 63% ) of the project group had no admission during the 10 month study period . Initially , the burden on the relatives of the project group was higher , but by one month it was somewhat lower and by four months it was significantly lower than the burden on the control group relatives . Relatives of the project group patients were significantly more satisfied with the treatment than control group relatives . It is clearly feasible to treat most <font color="red">psychiatric_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> in the community without increasing the burden on their <font color="red">relatives_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
