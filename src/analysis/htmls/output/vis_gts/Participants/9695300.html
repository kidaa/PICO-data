<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The role of bronchodilators in the treatment of <font color="red">bronchiolitis_2</font> remains controversial . 
<br> METHODS A double - blind , placebo controlled trial was performed to evaluate the clinical response to nebulized salbutamol . <font color="red">One_2</font> <font color="red">hundred_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">fifty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">six_2</font> <font color="red">infants_2</font> <font color="red">aged_2</font> <font color="red">between_2</font> <font color="red">7_2</font> <font color="red">weeks_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">24_2</font> <font color="red">months_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">an_2</font> <font color="red">episode_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">wheezing_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">other_2</font> <font color="red">signs_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">symptoms_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">bronchiolitis_2</font> were randomized to three groups as follows : ( i ) nebulized salbutamol was administered to 52 patients in group I at a dose of 0.15 mg / kg in 2 mL saline ; ( ii ) saline was nebulized to 52 patients in group II and ( iii ) in group III 52 patients received mist in a tent . All three groups were administered oxygen during the procedures . Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 min if the respiratory score was 5 or more . Respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation and presence of cyanosis , wheezing , retractions were recorded before and after each treatment . 
<br> RESULTS The decrease in the respiratory score was 5.2 + /- 1.8 , 0.82 + /- 2.4 and 1.7 + /- 1.3 in group I , II and III , respectively . The decrease in group I was significantly higher than in the other groups . Heart rate was similar between groups . Oxygen saturation decreased in group I without reaching statistical significance . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Salbutamol was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of <font color="red">acute_2</font> <font color="red">bronchiolitis_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
