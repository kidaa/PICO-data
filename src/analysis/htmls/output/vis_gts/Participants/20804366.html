<br> OBJECTIVE We aim to study the efficacy of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">spectrum_2</font> <font color="red">disorder_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS A single - blind randomized control trial was conducted in <font color="red">50_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> These <font color="red">children_1</font> were randomly assigned to the treatment group with tongue acupuncture ( 40 sessions over 8 weeks ) or the control group ( sham tongue acupuncture to nonacupoints in the tongue ) . 
<br> RESULTS There was improvement in both the treatment and control groups in all assessed measures but more so in the treatment than in the control group : ( 1 ) eye - hand coordination , performance , and practical reasoning of Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale ; ( 2 ) sensory - motor , social , affectual , language , and total score of Ritvo - Freeman Real Life Scale ; ( 3 ) Comprehension Language age in the Reynell Language Developmental Scale ; and ( 4 ) Total Score and Mental Age in Symbolic Play Test . The only statistically significant improvement in the treatment as compared to the control group was seen in self - care and cognition domains of the Functional Independence Measure for <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS We had demonstrated that a short course of acupuncture had efficacy in improving various developmental and behavioral aspects of <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The long - term efficacy in functional gain needs to be further explored .
