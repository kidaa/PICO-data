Superior visual search in <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> Recent studies have suggested that children with autism perform better than matched controls on visual search tasks and that this stems from a superior visual discrimination ability . This study assessed whether these findings generalize from children to <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Experiments 1 and 2 showed that , like children , <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> were superior to controls at searching for targets . Experiment 3 showed that increases in target - distractor similarity slowed the visual search performance of the control group significantly more than that of the autism group , suggesting that the <font color="red">adults_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">autism_1</font> have a superior visual discrimination ability . Thus , these experiments replicate in adults previous findings in children with autism . Superior unique item detection in <font color="red">adults_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">autism_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> stemming from enhanced discrimination , is discussed in the light of the possible role of stimulus processing disturbances in the disorder in general .
