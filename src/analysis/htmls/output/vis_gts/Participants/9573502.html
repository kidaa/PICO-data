<br> BACKGROUND Human brain natriuretic peptide ( hBNP ) is a promising agent for the treatment of <font color="red">decompensated_2</font> <font color="red">cardiac_2</font> <font color="red">failure_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> However , the systemic hemodynamic , neurohormonal , and renal effects of hBNP have been incompletely studied in <font color="red">human_1</font> <font color="red">heart_2</font> <font color="red">failure_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS The effects of a continuous 4-hour infusion of hBNP were determined in <font color="red">16_2</font> <font color="red">decompensated_2</font> <font color="red">heart_2</font> <font color="red">failure_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> in an invasive , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study . Patients were evaluated during three 4-hour study periods : baseline , treatment ( placebo [ n = 4 ] versus hBNP 0.025 or 0.05 microgram / kg / min [ n = 12 ] ) , and post - treatment . Urinary volume losses were replaced hourly to separate the vasodilatory and diuretic effects of hBNP . Two patients in the hBNP group were excluded from the analysis because of adverse events . hBNP significantly ( P < .001 ) reduced right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by approximately 30% and 40% , respectively . hBNP also significantly lowered systemic vascular resistance from 1722 + /- 139 to 1101 + /- 83 dynes.s.cm-5 ( P < .05 ) . These unloading effects of hBNP produced a 28% increase in cardiac index ( P < .05 ) with no change in heart rate . Compared to placebo , hBNP decreased plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone . Renal hemodynamics were unaffected by hBNP ; however , most patients were resistant to its natriuretic effect . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS 1 ) The predominant hemodynamic effects of hBNP were a decrease in cardiac preload and systemic vascular resistance . 2 ) hBNP also improved cardiac output without increasing heart rate . 3 ) Plasma norepinephrine and aldosterone levels decreased during hBNP infusion . 4 ) hBNP is pharmacologically active and has potential in the therapy for <font color="red">decompensated_2</font> <font color="red">heart_2</font> <font color="red">failure_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
