Bolus injection of contrast agents with various iodine concentrations and delivery rates for intracranial three - dimensional CT angiography : evaluation of intracranial arteriovenous contrast using a multidetector - row CT scanner . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE We evaluated the difference in computed tomography ( CT ) attenuation values of the intracranial arterial and venous systems among the various contrast injection protocols ( higher iodine delivery rate or higher concentration of the agent ) on the source images of intracranial three - dimensional CT angiography ( 3D - CTA ) using a multidetector - row CT ( MDCT ) scanner . 
<br> MATERIALS AND METHODS We used 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml / s , 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.7 ml / s , and 80 ml of iopamidol 370 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml / s . <font color="red">There_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">10_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">each_2</font> <font color="red">group_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Attenuation values of the bilateral internal carotid arteries ( ICAs ) , basilar artery trunk , bilateral cavernous sinuses ( CSs ) , and Galenic vein were measured quantitatively on the axial CT angiographic source images obtained by four - channel MDCT . 
<br> RESULTS Injection of the high - concentration contrast with a higher iodine - delivery rate achieved good arteriovenous contrast at the cavernous portion . With the same rate of iodine delivery , injection of the intermediate concentrate agent increased the CT value of not only the ICAs but also the CSs . 
<br> CONCLUSION High - concentration contrast could increase ICA attenuation without intracavernous attenuation gain during the " first - pass " phase .
