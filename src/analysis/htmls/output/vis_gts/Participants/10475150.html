<br>_1</font> Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species , which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion . Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown . We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in <font color="red">8_7</font> <font color="red">healthy_7</font> <font color="red">volunteers_7</font> <font color="red">,_7</font> <font color="red">and_6</font> <font color="red">6_7</font> <font color="red">women_7</font> <font color="red">with_7</font> <font color="red">untreated_7</font> <font color="red">primary_7</font> <font color="red">hypothyroidism_7</font> <font color="red">,_7</font> <font color="red">a_3</font> <font color="red">disease_3</font> <font color="red">state_3</font> <font color="red">that_3</font> <font color="red">is_3</font> <font color="red">associated_3</font> <font color="red">with_3</font> <font color="red">increased_3</font> <font color="red">nocturnal_3</font> <font color="red">secretion_3</font> <font color="red">of_3</font> <font color="red">melatonin_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font> The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide ( Sandostatin ; each injection 50 microg ) . During the nights when the <font color="red">healthy_2</font> <font color="red">volunteers_2</font> were given octreotide , melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline . Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions . By contrast , the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide ( GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU / l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.01 ) . <font color="red">The_1</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">hypothyroidism_2</font> also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during octreotide and saline . Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged , as did GH secretion . The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was , however , significantly reduced by octreotide ( TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU / l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.05 ) , thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin . Since exogenous somatostatin -- in the form of octreotide -- fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in <font color="red">normal_3</font> <font color="red">subjects_3</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">patients_3</font> <font color="red">with_3</font> <font color="red">primary_3</font> <font color="red">hypothyroidism_3</font> <font color="red">,_3</font> it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man .
