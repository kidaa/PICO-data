<br> Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species , which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion . Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown . We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in <font color="red">8_2</font> <font color="red">healthy_2</font> <font color="red">volunteers_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">6_2</font> <font color="red">women_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">untreated_2</font> <font color="red">primary_2</font> <font color="red">hypothyroidism_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin . The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide ( Sandostatin ; each injection 50 microg ) . During the nights when the <font color="red">healthy_1</font> <font color="red">volunteers_1</font> were given octreotide , melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline . Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions . By contrast , the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide ( GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU / l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.01 ) . The <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">hypothyroidism_1</font> also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during octreotide and saline . Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged , as did GH secretion . The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was , however , significantly reduced by octreotide ( TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU / l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.05 ) , thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin . Since exogenous somatostatin -- in the form of octreotide -- fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in <font color="red">normal_1</font> <font color="red">subjects_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">primary_2</font> <font color="red">hypothyroidism_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man .
