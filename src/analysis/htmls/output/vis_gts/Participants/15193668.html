<br> Authors examined the combined effects of descriptive and explanatory information on <font color="red">peers_1</font> <font color="red">'_1</font> perceptions and behavioral intentions toward an unfamiliar child with autism . <font color="red">Children_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">N_2</font> <font color="red">=_2</font> <font color="red">576_2</font> <font color="red">;_2</font> <font color="red">M_2</font> <font color="red">age_2</font> <font color="red">=_2</font> <font color="red">10.06_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> were randomly assigned to view two videotapes of a boy engaging in typical and autistic behaviors receiving either descriptive ( AUT - D ) or descriptive and explanatory information ( AUT - D + E ) . <font color="red">Children_1</font> responded to measures of attitudes ( Adjective Checklist ) and behavioral intentions ( Shared Activities Questionnaire ) . <font color="red">Children_1</font> rated the typical boy more favorably than the boy showing autistic symptoms . When compared to descriptive information alone , the combination of descriptive and explanatory information resulted in improved third- and fourth - graders ' but not fifth - graders ' attitudes toward the child with autism . Combined information improved behavioral intentions across grades ; however , girls ( vs. boys ) were more responsive to information as evidenced by differences in academic intentions . The combination of descriptive and explanatory information about autism appears to have a positive effect on <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">'s_1</font> attitudes and behavioral intentions . Implications of the findings are briefly discussed as well as study limitations and recommendations for future research .
