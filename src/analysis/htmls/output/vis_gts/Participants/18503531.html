<br> BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi - component social skills intervention for <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">Asperger_2</font> <font color="red">syndrome_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">AS_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">:_2</font> The Junior Detective Training Program . This 7-week program included a computer game , small group sessions , parent training sessions and teacher handouts . 
<br> METHOD <font color="red">Forty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">nine_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">AS_2</font> were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention ( n = 26 ) or wait - list control ( n = 23 ) conditions . 
<br> RESULTS Relative to children in the wait - list group , program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention , as indicated by parent - report measures . Teacher - report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post - treatment . Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion - management strategies for story characters at post - intervention than at pre - intervention , whereas control participants were not . However , there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body - posture recognition measures . Follow - up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post - intervention . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">AS_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed .
