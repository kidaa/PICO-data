<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS <font color="red">Patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">measurable_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">assessable_2</font> <font color="red">disease_2</font> were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg / m(2 ) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg / m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks . Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">A_1</font> <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">474_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">treated_1</font> ( 239 PLD and 235 topotecan ) . They comprised the intent - to - treat population . The overall progression - free survival rates were similar between the two arms ( P = .095 ) . The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0% , respectively ( P = .390 ) . Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan . Data analyzed in platinum - sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression - free survival ( P = .037 ) , with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan . For overall survival , PLD was significantly superior to topotecan ( P = .008 ) , with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks . The platinum - refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan ( P = .455 ) . Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification , or growth factor or blood product utilization . 
<br> CONCLUSION The comparable efficacy , favorable safety profile , and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population .
