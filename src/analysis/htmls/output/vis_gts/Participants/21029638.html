<br> OBJECTIVE To explore the efficacy of paliperidone extended - release tablets in the improvement of social functions in <font color="red">schizophrenics_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS A <font color="red">total_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">81_6</font> <font color="red">schizophrenics_6</font> were randomly divided into <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> with paliperidone extended - release tablets and <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> with risperidone for a 12-week treatment . They were assessed and analyzed by positive and negative symptoms scales ( PANSS ) , social disability screening schedule ( SDSS ) and treatment emergent symptom scale ( TESS ) at baseline , 6(th ) weekend and 12(th ) weekend . 
<br> RESULTS In <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the factors and total scores of PANSS in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 12.0 ± 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ± 3.6 ) , ( 26.2 ± 5.0 ) , ( 50.2 ± 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those at baseline [ ( 24.7 ± 5.3 ) , ( 23.8 ± 3.6 ) , ( 45.0 ± 2.9 ) , ( 93.5 ± 6.8 ) ] ( t = 9.60 - 16.78 , P < 0.05 ) . In <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the positive factor , negative factor and total scores of PANSS in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 12.0 ± 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ± 3.6 ) , ( 50.2 ± 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those in the 6(th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 14.2 ± 1.8 ) , ( 14.6 ± 2.4 ) , ( 56.5 ± 6.4 ) ] ( t = 2.58 - 4.26 , P < 0.05 ) . In the 12(th ) weekend of treatment , the factors and total scores of PANSS in <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> [ ( 12.0 ± 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ± 3.6 ) , ( 26.2 ± 5.0 ) , ( 50.2 ± 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those in <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> [ ( 16.9 ± 4.9 ) , ( 18.7 ± 5.3 ) , ( 32.5 ± 5.1 ) , ( 68.1 ± 13.0 ) ] ( t = -4.28 - -5.67 , P < 0.05 ) . In <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the total scores of SDSS in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment ( 5.93 ± 2.78 ) were significantly lower than those at baseline ( 13.9 ± 3.4 ) ( t = 10.83 , P < 0.05 ) . In <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> the total scores of SDSS in the 12(th ) weekend of treatment ( 5.9 ± 2.8 ) were significantly lower than those in the 6(th ) weekend of treatment ( 7.6 ± 2.9 ) ( t = 5.21 , P < 0.05 ) . But there was no significant improvement in <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( t = 1.88 , P > 0.05 ) . In the 12(th ) weekend of treatment , the total scores of SDSS in study group ( 5.9 ± 2.8 ) were significantly lower than those in <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> ( 8.8 ± 2.9 ) ( t = -4.49 , P < 0.05 ) . No severe adverse effect was reported in either <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSION Paliperidone extended - release tablets are effective to improve <font color="red">social_2</font> <font color="red">functions_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">psychiatric_2</font> <font color="red">symptoms_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">schizophrenics_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font>
