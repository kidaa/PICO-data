<br>
<br> BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure , physical activity , sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of <font color="red">depression_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> However , to our knowledge , there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy .

Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the 6 month intervention period . 
<br> DISCUSSION We expect the patients in the active recommendations group to experience a greater improvement in their depressive symptoms . If so , this would be a great support for doctors who might systematically recommend these simple and costless measures , especially in primary care .
