<br> OBJECTIVE <font color="red">Obsessive_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">compulsive_2</font> <font color="red">disorder_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">OCD_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">poor_2</font> <font color="red">insight_2</font> has severe consequences for patients ; nonetheless , no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for <font color="red">poor_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">insight_1</font> <font color="red">OCD_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> A new psychotherapy for <font color="red">OCD_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> the inference - based approach ( IBA ) , targets insight in <font color="red">OCD_1</font> by strengthening normal sensory - driven reality testing . The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) for <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">OCD_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">poor_2</font> <font color="red">insight_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted , in which <font color="red">90_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">OCD_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">poor_2</font> <font color="red">insight_2</font> received either 24 CBT sessions or 24 IBA sessions . The primary outcome measure was the Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) . Secondary outcome measures were level of insight , anxiety and depressive symptoms , and quality of life . Mixed - effects models were used to determine the treatment effect . 
<br> RESULTS In both conditions , a significant <font color="red">OCD_1</font> symptom reduction was reached , but no condition effects were established . Post hoc , in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight ( n = 23 ) , it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher <font color="red">OCD_1</font> symptom reduction than the patients treated with CBT [ estimated marginal mean = -7.77 , t(219.45 ) = -2.4 , p = 0.017 ] . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">Patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">OCD_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">poor_2</font> <font color="red">insight_2</font> improve significantly after psychological treatment . The results of this study suggest that both CBT and the IBA are effective treatments for <font color="red">OCD_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">poor_2</font> <font color="red">insight_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The IBA might be more promising than CBT for patients with more extreme poor insight .
