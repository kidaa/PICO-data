<br> OBJECTIVE <font color="red">Obsessive_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">compulsive_1</font> <font color="red">disorder_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">OCD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> with poor insight has severe consequences for patients ; nonetheless , no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for poor - insight OCD . A new psychotherapy for OCD , the inference - based approach ( IBA ) , targets insight in OCD by strengthening normal sensory - driven reality testing . The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) for <font color="red">patients_3</font> <font color="red">with_3</font> <font color="red">OCD_3</font> <font color="red">with_3</font> <font color="red">poor_3</font> <font color="red">insight_3</font> <font color="red">._3</font> 
<br> METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted , in which <font color="red">90_6</font> <font color="red">patients_6</font> <font color="red">with_6</font> <font color="red">OCD_6</font> <font color="red">with_6</font> <font color="red">poor_6</font> <font color="red">insight_6</font> <font color="red">received_2</font> <font color="red">either_2</font> <font color="red">24_2</font> <font color="red">CBT_2</font> <font color="red">sessions_2</font> <font color="red">or_2</font> <font color="red">24_2</font> <font color="red">IBA_2</font> <font color="red">sessions_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The primary outcome measure was the Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) . Secondary outcome measures were level of insight , anxiety and depressive symptoms , and quality of life . Mixed - effects models were used to determine the treatment effect . 
<br> RESULTS In both conditions , a significant OCD symptom reduction was reached , but no condition effects were established . Post hoc , in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight ( n = 23 ) , it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher OCD symptom reduction than the patients treated with CBT [ estimated marginal mean = -7.77 , t(219.45 ) = -2.4 , p = 0.017 ] . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="red">Patients_3</font> <font color="red">with_3</font> <font color="red">OCD_3</font> <font color="red">with_3</font> <font color="red">poor_3</font> <font color="red">insight_3</font> <font color="red">improve_1</font> <font color="red">significantly_1</font> after psychological treatment . The results of this study suggest that both CBT and the IBA are effective treatments for OCD with poor insight . The IBA might be more promising than CBT for patients with more extreme poor insight .
