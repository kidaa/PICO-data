Although an increasing number of group - based programs for the improvement of social skills have been described , randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy . To compare the effect of a Social Skills Training Group - based Program ( SST - GP ) and a Leisure Activities Group - based Program ( LA - GP ) on the perception of facial emotions and quality of life ( QoL ) in <font color="red">young_2</font> <font color="red">people_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">HFA_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Eligible_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">were_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">adolescents_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">HFA_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Participants were randomized to the SST or LA group . The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling ( DANVA2 ) from baseline . After the 6-month training period , the SST Group made fewer errors in labeling anger on adult faces , whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable . Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces . QoL increased in the SST Group in the dimension of school environment , as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community . The SST - GP had higher efficacy than the LA - GP . Data justify replication using larger samples .
