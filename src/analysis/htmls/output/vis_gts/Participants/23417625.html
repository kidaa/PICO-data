<br> High - functioning autism ( HFA ) is characterized by persistent impairment in social interaction despite the absence of mental retardation . Although an increasing number of <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">based_1</font> programs for the improvement of social skills have been described , randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy . To compare the effect of a Social Skills Training Group - based Program ( SST - GP ) and a Leisure Activities Group - based Program ( LA - GP ) on the perception of facial emotions and quality of life ( QoL ) in <font color="red">young_1</font> <font color="red">people_1</font> with HFA . <font color="red">Eligible_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">children_5</font> <font color="red">and_5</font> <font color="red">adolescents_5</font> <font color="red">with_4</font> <font color="red">HFA_4</font> <font color="red">._4</font> <font color="red">Participants_1</font> were randomized to the <font color="red">SST_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">LA_1</font> <font color="red">group_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling ( DANVA2 ) from baseline . After the 6-month training period , the <font color="red">SST_1</font> <font color="red">Group_1</font> made fewer errors in labeling anger on <font color="red">adult_1</font> faces , whereas error rates in the <font color="red">LA_1</font> <font color="red">Group_1</font> remained stable . Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces . QoL increased in the <font color="red">SST_1</font> <font color="red">Group_1</font> in the dimension of school environment , as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community . The <font color="red">SST_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">GP_1</font> had higher efficacy than the <font color="red">LA_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">GP_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Data justify replication using larger samples .
