<br> OBJECTIVE To study the clinical efficacy of the laparoscopic surgery in combination of Quyu Jiedu Recipe ( QYJDR ) on <font color="red">endometriosis_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">EMs)-related_2</font> <font color="red">infertility_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS <font color="red">130_2</font> <font color="red">EMs_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">related_2</font> <font color="red">infertility_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">blood_2</font> <font color="red">stasis_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">toxin_2</font> <font color="red">accumulation_2</font> <font color="red">syndrome_2</font> <font color="red">diagnosed_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">treated_1</font> <font color="red">by_1</font> <font color="red">laparoscopic_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> were randomly assigned to two groups , i.e. , the test group ( 75 cases ) and the control group ( 55 cases ) . <font color="red">All_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">received_1</font> <font color="red">routine_1</font> <font color="red">progesterone_1</font> <font color="red">treatment_1</font> <font color="red">after_1</font> <font color="red">laparoscopic_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> QYJDR was given to patients in the test group after laparoscopic surgery , lasting for twelve months . The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups . The Chinese medicine syndrome integrals , serum endometrium antibody ( EMAb ) and cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) levels were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy . 
<br> RESULTS The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the test group than in the control group [ 61.33% ( 46/75 ) vs 45.45% ( 25/55 ) ] , showing significant difference ( P<0.05 ) . The Chinese medicine syndrome integral was ( 16.07 + /- 6.77 ) score and ( 7.25 + /- 3.27 ) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the test group , while it was ( 15.92 + /- 7.51 ) score and ( 12.73 + /- 6.12 ) score in the control group . The Chinese medicine syndrome integral after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group . Besides , the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [ ( 9.12 + /- 6.16 ) score vs ( 3.48 + /- 2.06 ) score ) ] , showing statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . After three - month drug therapy , the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group ( 44.44% vs 15.62% ) , showing statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . The serum CA125 level was ( 31.88 + /- 15.78 ) U / mL before drug therapy and ( 18.82 + /- 10.08 ) U / mL three months after drug therapy in the test group , while it was ( 30.63 + /- 19.28 ) U / mL and ( 18.05 + /- 11.20 ) U / mL respectively in the control group . It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference ( P<0.05 ) . There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy ( P>0.05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of <font color="red">EMs_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">blood_1</font> <font color="red">stasis_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">toxin_1</font> <font color="red">accumulation_1</font> <font color="red">syndrome_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> promote negative conversion of EMAb , lower serum CA125 levels , and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate . QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of <font color="red">EMs_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">related_2</font> <font color="red">infertility_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
