<br> BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the behavioral and biochemical responses to acute tryptophan depletion in <font color="red">drug_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">free_1</font> <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">autistic_2</font> <font color="red">disorder_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>

Patients received a 24-hour , low - tryptophan diet followed the next morning by an amino acid drink . Behavioral ratings were obtained on the morning of the amino acid drink ( baseline ) and 180 , 300 , and 420 minutes after the drink . Plasma free and total tryptophan levels were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink . The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days . 
<br> RESULTS Eleven ( 65% ) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of behavioral symptoms with short - term tryptophan depletion , but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in clinical status from baseline after sham depletion ( P = .001 ) . Tryptophan depletion led to a significant increase in behaviors such as whirling , flapping , pacing , banging and hitting self , rocking , and toe walking ( P < .05 ) . In addition , patients were significantly less calm and happy and more anxious . No significant change was observed in social relatedness or repetitive thoughts and behavior . Plasma total and free tryptophan levels were reduced 86% and 69% , respectively , 5 hours after the tryptophan - deficient amino acid drink . Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline plasma total tryptophan levels ( P < .001 ) and Autism Behavior Checklist scores ( P = .005 ) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after tryptophan depletion . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> These data suggest that the short - term reduction of serotonin precursor availability may exacerbate some symptoms characteristic of <font color="red">autism_2</font> in some patients . Continued investigation into the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis and treatment of <font color="red">autistic_2</font> <font color="red">disorder_2</font> is warranted .
