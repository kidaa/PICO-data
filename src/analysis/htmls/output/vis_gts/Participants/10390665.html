<br> We have compared the efficacy of granisetron with perphenazine in the prevention of vomiting after <font color="red">tonsillectomy_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">without_1</font> <font color="red">adenoidectomy_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In a prospective , randomized , double - blind study , <font color="red">90_1</font> <font color="red">paediatric_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">ASA_1</font> <font color="red">I_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">aged_1</font> <font color="red">4_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">10_1</font> <font color="red">years_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> received granisetron 40 mg kg-1 or perphenazine 70 mg kg-1 ( n = 45 each ) intravenously immediately after an inhalation induction of anaesthesia . A standard general anaesthetic technique was employed throughout . A complete response , defined as no emesis with no need for another rescue antiemetic , during the first 3 h ( 0 - 3 h ) after anesthesia was 87% with granisetron and 78% with perphenazine ( P = 0.204 ) . The corresponding incidence during the next 21 h ( 3 - 24 h ) after anaesthesia was 87% and 62% ( P = 0.007 ) . No clinically serious adverse events were observed in any of the groups . We conclude that granisetron is a better anti - emetic than perphenazine for the long - term prevention of post - operative vomiting in <font color="red">children_1</font> <font color="red">undergoing_1</font> <font color="red">general_1</font> <font color="red">anaesthesia_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">tonsillectomy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
