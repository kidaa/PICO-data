Near normoglycaemia was achieved with continuous infusion and multiple injections but not with conventional treatment . Blind evaluation of fluorescein angiograms performed three monthly showed progression of retinopathy in the control group , transient deterioration in the continuous infusion group , and no change in the multiple injection group . Half the patients receiving continuous infusion and multiple injections developed retinal cotton wool spots after three to six months . These changes regressed in all but four patients after 12 months . Control patients did not develop cotton wool spots . Patients who developed cotton wool spots are characterised by a larger decrement in glycosylated haemoglobin and blood glucose values , more frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia , a longer duration of diabetes , and more severe retinopathy at onset . A large and rapid fall in blood glucose concentration may promote transient deterioration of diabetic retinopathy .
