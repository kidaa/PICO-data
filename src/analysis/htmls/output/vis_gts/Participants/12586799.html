<br> PURPOSE <font color="red">Nasopharyngeal_2</font> <font color="red">carcinoma_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">NPC_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> is a radiosensitive and chemosensitive tumor . This randomized phase III trial compared concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) versus radiotherapy ( RT ) alone in <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">advanced_2</font> <font color="red">NPC_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>

Similar dosage and fractionation of RT was administered in both arms . The investigational arm received two cycles of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 20 mg / m(2)/d plus fluorouracil 400 mg / m(2)/d by 96-hour continuous infusion during the weeks 1 and 5 of RT . Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan - Meier method and compared by the log - rank test . 
<br> RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in both arms . After a median follow - up of 65 months , 26.2% ( 37 of 141 ) and 46.2% ( 66 of 143 ) of patients developed tumor relapse in the CCRT and RT - alone groups , respectively . The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.3% for the CCRT arm and 54.2% for the RT - only arm ( P = .0022 ) . The 5-year progression - free survival rates were 71.6% for the CCRT group compared with 53.0% for the RT - only group ( P = .0012 ) . Although significantly more toxicity was noted in the CCRT arm , including leukopenia and emesis , compliance with the combined treatment was good . The second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was refused by nine patients and was delayed for > or = 1 week for another nine patients . There were no treatment - related deaths in either arm . 
<br> CONCLUSION We conclude that CCRT is superior to RT alone for <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">advanced_2</font> <font color="red">NPC_2</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">endemic_1</font> <font color="red">areas_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
