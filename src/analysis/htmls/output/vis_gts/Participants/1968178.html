Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg ( hypertensive and normotensive subjects , respectively ) . Wearing the inflated cuff did not change blood pressure . Thus the rise in pressure was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation . Systolic blood pressure took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation . Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10 - 15 s when following recommended procedures , self - recorded systolic blood pressure may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast .
