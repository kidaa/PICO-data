Use of hormonal contraceptives and risk of <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> transmission : a prospective cohort study . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Hormonal contraceptives are used widely but their effects on <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> risk are unclear . We aimed to assess the association between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from HIV-1-infected women to their male partners . 
<br> METHODS In this prospective study , we followed up <font color="red">3790_2</font> <font color="red">heterosexual_2</font> <font color="red">HIV-1-serodiscordant_2</font> <font color="red">couples_2</font> <font color="red">participating_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">two_2</font> <font color="red">longitudinal_2</font> <font color="red">studies_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">HIV-1_2</font> <font color="red">incidence_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">seven_2</font> <font color="red">African_2</font> <font color="red">countries_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non - users , we compared rates of <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men . The primary outcome measure was HIV-1 seroconversion . We used Cox proportional hazards regression and marginal structural modelling to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk . 
<br> FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the <font color="red">HIV-1-seronegative_1</font> <font color="red">partner_1</font> was female ( median follow - up 18·0 [ IQR 12·6 - 24·2 ] months ) , rates of <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> acquisition were 6·61 per 100 person - years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3·78 per 100 person - years in those who did not ( adjusted hazard ratio 1·98 , 95% CI 1·06 - 3·68 , p=0·03 ) . Among 2476 couples in which the <font color="red">HIV-1-seronegative_1</font> <font color="red">partner_1</font> was male ( median follow - up 18·7 [ IQR 12·8 - 24·2 ] months ) , rates of <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> transmission from women to men were 2·61 per 100 person - years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1·51 per 100 person - years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception ( adjusted hazard ratio 1·97 , 95% CI 1·12 - 3·45 , p=0·02 ) . Marginal structural model analyses generated much the same results to the Cox proportional hazards regression . 
<br> INTERPRETATION Women should be counselled about potentially increased risk of <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> acquisition and transmission with hormonal contraception , especially injectable methods , and about the importance of dual protection with condoms to decrease <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> risk . Non - hormonal or low - dose hormonal contraceptive methods should be considered for <font color="red">women_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">risk_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">HIV-1_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
