Effects of individualized breast cancer risk counseling : a randomized trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Studies have shown that a majority of <font color="red">women_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">family_2</font> <font color="red">history_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> have exaggerated perceptions of their own risk of this disease and experience excessive anxiety . In response to the need to communicate more accurate risk information to these women , specialized programs for breast cancer risk counseling have been initiated in medical centers across the United States . 
<br> PURPOSE Our purpose was 1 ) to evaluate the impact of a standardized protocol for individualized breast cancer risk counseling on comprehension of personal risk among <font color="red">first_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">degree_1</font> <font color="red">relatives_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">index_1</font> <font color="red">breast_1</font> <font color="red">cancer_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> and 2 ) to identify <font color="red">women_1</font> most and least likely to benefit from such counseling . 
<br> METHODS This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing individualized breast cancer risk counseling to general health counseling ( control ) . We studied <font color="red">200_2</font> <font color="red">women_2</font> <font color="red">aged_2</font> <font color="red">35_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">older_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">family_2</font> <font color="red">history_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">first_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">degree_2</font> <font color="red">relative_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Women_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">personal_2</font> <font color="red">history_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">were_2</font> <font color="red">excluded_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Risk comprehension was assessed as the concordance between perceived " subjective " lifetime breast cancer risk and estimated " objective " lifetime risk . 
<br> RESULTS The results of logistic regression analysis showed that <font color="red">women_1</font> who received risk counseling were significantly more likely to improve their risk comprehension , compared with <font color="red">women_1</font> in the control condition ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.5 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.3 - 9.5 ; P = .01 ) . However , in both groups , about two thirds of <font color="red">women_1</font> continued to overestimate their lifetime risks substantially following counseling . Examination of subjects by treatment interaction effects indicated that risk counseling did not produce improved comprehension among the large proportion of <font color="red">women_1</font> who had high levels of anxious preoccupation with breast cancer at base line ( P = .02 ) . In addition , white <font color="red">women_1</font> were less likely to benefit than African - American <font color="red">women_1</font> ( OR = 0.34 ; 95% CI = 0.11 - 0.99 ; P = .05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Efforts to counsel <font color="red">women_1</font> about their breast cancer risks are not likely to be effective unless their breast cancer anxieties are also addressed . 
<br> IMPLICATIONS Attention to the psychological aspects of breast cancer risk will be critical in the development of risk - counseling programs that incorporate testing for the recently cloned breast cancer susceptibility gene , BRCA1 ( and BRCA2 when that gene has also been cloned ) .
