<br> PURPOSE Recently , new <font color="red">custom_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">fit_1</font> <font color="red">pin_1</font> <font color="red">guides_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">total_2</font> <font color="red">knee_2</font> <font color="red">arthroplasty_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">TKA_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> have been introduced . Use of these guides may reduce operating time . Use of the guides combined with the absence of intramedullary alignment jigs may lead to reduced blood loss and improved early outcomes . Our aim was to evaluate blood loss and early clinical outcomes in <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">undergoing_2</font> <font color="red">minimally_2</font> <font color="red">invasive_2</font> <font color="red">TKA_2</font> <font color="red">using_1</font> <font color="red">custom_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">fit_1</font> <font color="red">magnetic_1</font> <font color="red">resonance_1</font> <font color="red">imaging_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">MRI)-based_1</font> <font color="red">pin_1</font> <font color="red">guides_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS A prospective study in <font color="red">80_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> was carried out . Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups . In one group , intramedullary alignment jigs were used . In the second group , custom - fit MRI - based pin guides were used . All patients received the same cemented posterior - stabilized implant through a mini - midvastus approach . The volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. Hb loss was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative Hb level . Transfusion requirements and surgical time were recorded . Outcome measures were Knee Society Scores ( KSS ) , knee flexion , knee swelling and pain . 
<br> RESULTS There was lower mean drainage of blood in the custom - fit group ( 391 ml vs. 603 ml ; p < 0.0001 ) . There was no difference in estimated loss of Hb ( 3.6 g / dl vs. 4.1 g / dl ; n.s . ) and in transfusion requirements ( 7.5 % vs. 10 % ; n.s . ) . Surgical time was reduced in the custom - fit group ( 12 min less ; p = 0.001 ) . KSS measured at week 2 , 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups . Knee flexion measured on days 7 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 and knee swelling and pain measured on days 1 , 3 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 showed no significant difference between groups . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Using custom - fit pin guides reduces blood drainage , but not the estimated Hb loss in minimally invasive TKA and does not affect transfusion rate . Surgical time is reduced . There is no effect on the early clinical outcomes .
