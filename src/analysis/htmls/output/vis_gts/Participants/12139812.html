<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effects of limbal epithelial autograft transplantation and <font color="red">pterygium_1</font> excision in the treatment of <font color="red">pterygium_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS A prospective randomized paired - eye trial was studied . There were <font color="red">208_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">229_2</font> <font color="red">eyes_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">initial_2</font> <font color="red">pterygium_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and they were allocated to two groups : excision of <font color="red">pterygium_1</font> with limbal epithelial autograft transplantation surgery ( A group , 106 cases and 124 eyes ) and simple pterygium excision ( B group , 102 cases and 105 eyes ) . The criteria for recovery were corneal transparency with stable epithelial healing and no abnormal proliferation of <font color="red">pterygium_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> like tissue . The post - operative follow - up periods ranged from 18 approximately 28 ( 22.4 + /- 4.9 ) months . 
<br> RESULTS Some of the patients lost follow - up . In the eyes followed up , 5 of 11 2 eyes ( 4.5% ) in A group and 41 of 96 eyes ( 42.7% ) in B group were recurred , the difference being very significant ( P < 0.001 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION To provide a new stem cell source , limbal epithelial autograft transplantation , for an injured limb us is a reasonable therapeutic method for the treatment of <font color="red">pterygium_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
