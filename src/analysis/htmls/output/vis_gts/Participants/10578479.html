Effects of soy intake on sex hormone metabolism in <font color="red">premenopausal_2</font> <font color="red">women_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> Studies suggest that phytoestrogens in soy products may impart hormonal effects that protect <font color="red">women_1</font> against breast cancer . Limited research suggests that intake of soy products high in isoflavonoid phytoestrogens affects sex hormone metabolism , but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in <font color="red">women_1</font> on common hormone therapies , such as oral contraceptives ( OC ) . We studied the effects of soy in <font color="red">36_2</font> <font color="red">premenopausal_2</font> <font color="red">women_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">20_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">whom_1</font> <font color="red">used_1</font> <font color="red">OC_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a soy beverage containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total isoflavones to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles . No significant differences were observed in serum estrone , estradiol , sex hormone - binding globulin , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate , prolactin , or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non - OC or the OC group . No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha - hydroxyestrone were seen with soy feeding in the non - OC or the OC group . Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non - OC and the OC group . Thus soy consumption had no significant effect on the menstrual cycle , serum sex hormones , or urinary estrogen metabolite ratio in <font color="red">premenopausal_1</font> <font color="red">OC_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">non_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">OC_1</font> <font color="red">users_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
