<br> BACKGROUND Postoperative epidural analgesia ( EA ) and femoral nerve block ( FNB ) provided effective pain relief However , EA has common side effects such as nausea , vomiting , pruritus , dizziness , and hypotension . Some investigations found that those side effects were less in FNB than in EA . However the analgesic equivalent of both techniques have not been confirmed . 
<br> OBJECTIVE The authors compared continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) with continuous femoral nerve block ( CFNB ) regarding the postoperative analgesic efficacy , side effects , postoperative knee rehabilitation , and <font color="red">hospital_1</font> length of stay ( LOS ) .

In the ward , patients in Group I ( CEI ) were maintained by continuous infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine with morphine 0.0125 mg / ml ( 4 ml / hr ) , Group II ( CFNB ) were maintained by 0.125% levobupivacaine ( 8 ml / hr ) . 
<br> RESULTS Patients in the CFNB group , the VAS scores at PO6 - 12 hr and tramadol IV requirement were significantly greater than the CEI group ( VAS : PO6 hr p - value = 0.001 , PO12 hr p - value = 0.004 ) . Patients in the CEI group experienced dizziness , pruritus , and PONV more than the CFNB group significantly . Patient satisfaction was greater with the CFNB group although postoperative knee rehabilitation and the hospital LOS were not different . 
<br> CONCLUSION CFNB represents the optimal analgesia with fewer side effects and greater patient , satisfaction . The rehabilitation indices and duration of hospital stay are comparable in both groups .
