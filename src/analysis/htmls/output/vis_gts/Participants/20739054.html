Eltrombopag for management of <font color="red">chronic_2</font> <font color="red">immune_2</font> <font color="red">thrombocytopenia_2</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">RAISE_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">:_1</font> a 6-month , randomised , phase 3 study . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist for the treatment of <font color="red">thrombocytopenia_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> We aimed to compare the response to once daily eltrombopag versus placebo in <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">chronic_2</font> <font color="red">immune_2</font> <font color="red">thrombocytopenia_2</font> during a 6-month period . 
<br> METHODS We undertook a phase 3 , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">previously_2</font> <font color="red">treated_2</font> <font color="red">immune_2</font> <font color="red">thrombocytopenia_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">more_2</font> <font color="red">than_2</font> <font color="red">6_2</font> <font color="red">months_2</font> <font color="red">'_2</font> <font color="red">duration_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">baseline_2</font> <font color="red">platelet_2</font> <font color="red">counts_2</font> <font color="red">lower_2</font> <font color="red">than_2</font> <font color="red">30,000_2</font> <font color="red">per_2</font> <font color="red">μL._2</font> Patients were randomly allocated ( in a 2:1 ratio ) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months . Randomisation was done centrally with a computer - generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count ( ≤ 15,000 per μL ) , use of treatment for <font color="red">immune_1</font> <font color="red">thrombocytopenia_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and splenectomy status . Patients , investigators , and those assessing data were masked to allocation . Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response . Patients were assessed for response to treatment ( defined as a platelet count of 50,000 - 400,000 per μL ) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter ; the primary endpoint was the odds of response to eltrombopag versus placebo . Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00370331 . 
<br> FINDINGS <font color="red">Between_1</font> <font color="red">Nov_1</font> <font color="red">22_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">2006_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">July_1</font> <font color="red">31_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">2007_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">197_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention - to - treat analysis ( 135 eltrombopag , 62 placebo ) . 106 ( 79% ) patients in the eltrombopag group responded to treatment at least once during the study , compared with 17 ( 28% ) patients in the placebo group . The odds of responding were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period ( odds ratio 8·2 , 99% CI 3·59 - 18·73 ; p<0·0001 ) . 37 ( 59% ) patients receiving eltrombopag reduced concomitant treatment versus ten ( 32% ) patients receiving placebo ( p=0·016 ) . 24 ( 18% ) patients receiving eltrombopag needed rescue treatment compared with 25 ( 40% ) patients receiving placebo ( p=0·001 ) . Three ( 2% ) patients receiving eltrombopag had thromboembolic events compared with none in patients on placebo . Nine ( 7% ) eltrombopag - treated patients and two ( 3% ) in the placebo group had mild increases in alanine aminotransferase concentration , and five ( 4% ) eltrombopag - treated patients ( vs none allocated to placebo ) had increases in total bilirubin . Four ( 7% ) patients taking placebo had serious bleeding events , compared with one ( < 1% ) patient treated with eltrombopag . 
<br> INTERPRETATION Eltrombopag is effective for management of <font color="red">chronic_2</font> <font color="red">immune_2</font> <font color="red">thrombocytopenia_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment . These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with eltrombopag treatment .
