<br> The pain - relieving effect of indomethacin phonophoresis on <font color="red">temporomandibular_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">TMJ_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">joint_2</font> <font color="red">pain_2</font> was evaluated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial . <font color="red">Twenty_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">have_2</font> <font color="red">TMJ_2</font> <font color="red">pain_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> were included for this study and randomly assigned to either the experimental group ( n = 10 ) or the control group ( n = 10 ) . Each treatment consisted of the application of ultrasound massage ( 1.0 MHz , 0.8 to 1.5 W / cm2 continuous output ) for 15 minutes to the painful temporomandibular joint . As a conducting medium , 1% indomethacin cream was used for the experimental group and placebo cream for the control group respectively . Pre- and post - treatment pain levels and pain sensitivity were assessed with visual analogue scales ( VAS ) and pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) . Mean data indicated that post - treatment VAS was significantly decreased and post - treatment PPT was significantly increased in the experimental group , not in the control group . The results of this study suggest that indomethacin phonophoresis provides significant pain relieving effect over the <font color="red">TMJ_2</font> <font color="red">pain_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
