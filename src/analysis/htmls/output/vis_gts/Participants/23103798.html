Role of posterior tibial nerve stimulation in the treatment of <font color="red">refractory_2</font> <font color="red">monosymptomatic_2</font> <font color="red">nocturnal_2</font> <font color="red">enuresis_2</font> <font color="red">:_2</font> a pilot study . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE We evaluated the early clinical and urodynamic results of posterior tibial nerve stimulation in <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">refractory_2</font> <font color="red">monosymptomatic_2</font> <font color="red">nocturnal_2</font> <font color="red">enuresis_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> MATERIALS AND METHODS We randomly assigned <font color="red">28_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">refractory_2</font> <font color="red">monosymptomatic_2</font> <font color="red">nocturnal_2</font> <font color="red">enuresis_2</font> to 2 equal groups . Group 1 received a weekly session of posterior tibial nerve stimulation for 12 weeks and group 2 was the placebo group . Evaluation was performed in each group at baseline and after posterior tibial nerve stimulation to compare clinical and urodynamic findings . Another clinical assessment was done 3 months after the first followup . 
<br> RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable in baseline clinical and urodynamic data . Overall , 13 patients ( 46.4% ) had detrusor overactivity and 14 ( 50% ) had decreased bladder capacity . After treatment 11 group 1 patients ( 78.6% ) had a partial or full response to posterior tibial nerve stimulation but only 2 ( 14.3% ) in group 2 had a partial response ( p = 0.002 ) . Also , the average number of wet nights in group 1 was significantly lower than at baseline ( p = 0.002 ) . All urodynamic parameters significantly improved in group 1 . In contrast , the number of wet nights and urodynamic parameters did not change significantly in group 2 . At 3-month followup the number of patients with a partial or full response in group 1 had decreased from 11 ( 78.6% ) to 6 ( 42.9% ) . No change was evident in group 2 . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Posterior tibial nerve stimulation can be a viable treatment option in some <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">refractory_2</font> <font color="red">monosymptomatic_2</font> <font color="red">nocturnal_2</font> <font color="red">enuresis_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> However , deterioration in some responders with time suggests the need for maintenance protocols .
