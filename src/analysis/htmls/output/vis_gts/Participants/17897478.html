<br> BACKGROUND Few studies have compared treatment strategies in <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">asthma_2</font> <font color="red">poorly_1</font> <font color="red">controlled_1</font> <font color="red">on_1</font> <font color="red">low_1</font> <font color="red">dose_1</font> <font color="red">inhaled_1</font> <font color="red">corticosteroids_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and little is known about the effects of different treatments on airway inflammation . In this double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group study , we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate ( FP ) ( Seretide ; SFC ) and FP plus montelukast ( FP / M ) on sputum inflammatory markers , airway responsiveness , lung function , and symptoms in <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">asthmatics_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS <font color="red">Sixty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">six_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> were randomised to SFC or FP / M for 12 weeks . The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil , eosinophil , macrophage , lymphocyte , and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum . Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation , airway responsiveness , symptom control , and lung function . 
<br> RESULTS Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells , although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils . Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness , whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP / M. FP / M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC ( treatment ratio 1.80 ; 95% CI 1.09 , 2.94 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Both treatments led to similar control of eosinophilic airway inflammation , although PEF and symptom control were better with SFC . STUDY NUMBER : SAM40030 ( SOLTA ) .
