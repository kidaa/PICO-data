<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Social skills training ( SST ) is a common intervention for <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">spectrum_2</font> <font color="red">disorders_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">ASDs_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> to improve their social and communication skills . Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice , the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> is inconclusive . Moreover , long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated . Additionally , there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life . We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life . 
<br> METHOD / DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with three conditions , <font color="red">120_2</font> <font color="red">participants_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> <font color="red">at_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">end_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">primary_2</font> <font color="red">school_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">10_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">12_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">calendar_2</font> <font color="red">age_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> have been randomized to SST , SST - PTI ( SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement ) , or care - as - usual . The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children . In the SST - PTI condition , parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments . Assessment takes place at three moments : before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow - up . Primary outcome is socialization , as an aspect of adaptive functioning . Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during SST and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi - informant perspective . Additionally , possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed . 
<br> DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of <font color="red">Dutch_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> <font color="red">in_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">specific_2</font> <font color="red">age_2</font> <font color="red">range_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">10_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">12_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol , application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments , use of multiple raters , investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life , and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow - up measures at 6 months after the end of training .
