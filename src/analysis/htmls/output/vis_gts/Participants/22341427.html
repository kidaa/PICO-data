<br> OBJECTIVE The study objective was to identify factors associated with death and cardiac transplantation in <font color="red">infants_1</font> <font color="red">undergoing_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">Norwood_1</font> <font color="red">procedure_1</font> and to determine differences in associations that might favor the modified Blalock - Taussig shunt or a right ventricle - to - pulmonary artery shunt . 
<br> METHODS We used competing risks methodology to analyze death without transplantation , cardiac transplantation , and survival without transplantation . Parametric time - to - event modeling and bootstrapping were used to identify independent predictors . 
<br> RESULTS Data from <font color="red">549_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">follow_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">up_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">2.7_2</font> <font color="red">Â±_2</font> <font color="red">0.9_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> were analyzed . Mortality risk was characterized by early and constant phases ; transplant was characterized by only a constant phase . Early phase factors associated with death included lower socioeconomic status ( P = .01 ) , obstructed pulmonary venous return ( P < .001 ) , smaller ascending aorta ( P = .02 ) , and anatomic subtype . Constant phase factors associated with death included genetic syndrome ( P < .001 ) and lower gestational age ( P < .001 ) . The right ventricle - to - pulmonary artery shunt demonstrated better survival in the 51% of subjects who were full term with aortic atresia ( P < .001 ) . The modified Blalock - Taussig shunt was better among the 4% of subjects who were preterm with a patent aortic valve ( P = .003 ) . Lower pre - Norwood right ventricular fractional area change , pre - Norwood surgery , and anatomy other than hypoplastic left heart syndrome were independently associated with transplantation ( all P < .03 ) , but shunt type was not ( P = .43 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Independent risk factors for intermediate - term mortality include lower socioeconomic status , anatomy , genetic syndrome , and lower gestational age . Term infants with aortic atresia benefited from a right ventricle - to - pulmonary artery shunt , and preterm infants with a patent aortic valve benefited from a modified Blalock - Taussig shunt . Right ventricular function and anatomy , but not shunt type , were associated with transplantation .
