Nitrendipine was given orally at a dosage of 20 mg once daily over 4 weeks . Stimulated platelet thromboxane formation at rest and after standardized , non exhausting exercise was measured by standard methods . In addition , plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and aggregation responses to collagen and ADP were determined . In the treatment group thromboxane formation after stimulation with collagen ( 0.3 and 1.0 micrograms / ml ) and 1 mM arachidonic acid ( AA ) was reduced in the resting state . Exercise induced change of thromboxane synthesis in response to 1.0 micrograms / ml collagen was significantly lower as compared to placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . In parallel , PF4 plasma levels were significantly lowered ( p < 0.05 ) . Whole blood aggregation after collagen stimulation ( 1.0 micrograms / ml ) was reduced after 4 weeks of nitrendipine treatment , but ADP ( 5 microM ) induced aggregation was not . These effects of nitrendipine were not seen in platelet rich plasma . In conclusion long - term nitrendipine treatment may inhibit collagen dependent platelet activation in the blood of <font color="red">diabetic_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">borderline_2</font> <font color="red">hypertension_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">
