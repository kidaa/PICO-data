The objectives of this study were to update the analyses of each individual trial and to analyze prognostic factors and treatment effects based on pooled data . 
<br> EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Survival and disease status were updated to April 2001 . Analysis of prognostic factors using optimized statistical models was based on data from patients in E1684 , E1690 , E1694 , and E2696 . Analysis of treatment effects versus observation ( Obs ) was based on data from 713 patients randomized to high - dose IFN - alpha 2b ( HDI ) or Obs in Trials E1684 and E1690 . 
<br> RESULTS Updated analysis of E1684 , E1690 , and E1694 confirmed their original conclusions , now at median follow - up intervals of 2.1 - 12.6 years . Based on two - sided univariate log - rank analysis of pooled data from E1684 and E1690 ( median follow - up , 7.2 years ) , relapse - free survival ( RFS)-but not overall survival ( OS)-was significantly prolonged ( two - sided log - rank P value = 0.006 ) for patients treated with HDI versus Obs . Among all patients , prognostic factors that significantly negatively impacted RFS and OS included ulceration , recurrent disease at entry , enrollment in E1684 , and age > 49 years . Multivariate statistical models adjusting for these factors confirmed the statistically significant RFS benefit of HDI versus Obs but did not demonstrate a significant OS benefit in the pooled populations . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">high_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">risk_2</font> <font color="red">resected_2</font> <font color="red">melanoma_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> HDI is effective adjuvant therapy with strong evidence for improved RFS and evidence for moderate improvement in OS based on two prospective randomized studies but not the pooled analysis . Analyses of predictors of relapse and response are now needed to improve the therapeutic value of this modality .
