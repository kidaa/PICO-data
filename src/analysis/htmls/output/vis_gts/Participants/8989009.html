Prevention of spinal anesthesia - induced hypotension in the <font color="red">elderly_2</font> <font color="red">:_2</font> comparison between preanesthetic administration of crystalloids , colloids , and no prehydration . 
<br>
<br> The practice of routinely prehydrating patients by infusing a crystalloid or colloid solution ( up to 1.0 L/70 kg ) for prevention of spinal anesthesia - induced hypotension has been challenged recently , after several reports of failure to demonstrate its efficacy in young women . We compared the incidence and frequency of hypotension and vasopressor therapy after spinal anesthesia and no prehydration with crystalloid and colloid prehydration in <font color="red">elderly_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Eighty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">five_2</font> <font color="red">ASA_2</font> <font color="red">grade_2</font> <font color="red">I_2</font> <font color="red">or_2</font> <font color="red">II_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">aged_2</font> <font color="red">60_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">89_2</font> <font color="red">yr_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">for_2</font> <font color="red">elective_2</font> <font color="red">total_2</font> <font color="red">hip_2</font> <font color="red">replacement_2</font> were randomized to receive 500 mL crystalloid solution ( Hartmanns , n = 29 ) , 500 mL colloid ( Haemaccel , n = 28 ) , or no prehydration ( n = 28 ) over 10 min prior to spinal anesthesia . Hypotension was defined as a 30% decrease from baseline systolic blood pressure ( BP ) or systolic < 90 mm Hg , and was treated with ephedrine 3-mg boluses . Although absolute systolic BP readings were significantly higher in the colloid group between 6 and 30 min ( P < 0.05 ) , the incidence of hypotension was not significantly different between the groups . The incidence of ephedrine use , incidence of nausea / vomiting , and median total dose of ephedrine were similar in all groups . We conclude that , in <font color="red">elderly_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">undergoing_2</font> <font color="red">elective_2</font> <font color="red">procedures_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> withholding prehydration is not associated with any greater degree of hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy compared with crystalloid or colloid prehydration .
