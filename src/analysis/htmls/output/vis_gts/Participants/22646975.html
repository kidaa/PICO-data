<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Inflammatory_2</font> <font color="red">Bowel_2</font> <font color="red">Disease_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">IBD_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> impacts quality of life ( QoL ) . Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for intervention . 
<br> METHODS Our study was a prospective , randomised control trial . <font color="red">Fifty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">six_2</font> <font color="red">outpatients_2</font> were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a waiting - list control group . Treatment group patients attended three relaxation - training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice . Evaluations performed pre and post - treatment : state anxiety was assessed with the State - Trait Anxiety Inventory , QoL with the IBD Questionnaire . The Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain , depression , stress and mood . Patients completed a symptom monitoring diary . The control group 's symptoms were monitored without study - related treatment . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Thirty_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">nine_1</font> <font color="red">subjects_1</font> <font color="red">completed_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">included_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">data_1</font> <font color="red">analysis_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Following the relaxation - training intervention , the treatment group 's ( n   =   18 ) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as compared to the control group ( n   =   21 ) ( time by treatment interaction ) : anxiety levels decreased ( p   <   0.01 ) , QoL and mood improved ( p   <   0.05 ) , while levels of pain and stress decreased ( p   <   0.01 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Findings indicate <font color="red">IBD_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> may benefit from relaxation training in their holistic care . New studies as well as further investigation of the subject are warranted .
