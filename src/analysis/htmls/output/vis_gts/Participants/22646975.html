<br> BACKGROUND Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) impacts quality of life ( QoL ) . Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for intervention . 
<br> METHODS Our study was a prospective , randomised control trial . <font color="red">Fifty_7</font> <font color="red">-_7</font> <font color="red">six_7</font> <font color="red">outpatients_7</font> were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a waiting - list control group . Treatment group patients attended three relaxation - training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice . Evaluations performed pre and post - treatment : state anxiety was assessed with the State - Trait Anxiety Inventory , QoL with the IBD Questionnaire . The Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain , depression , stress and mood . Patients completed a symptom monitoring diary . The control group 's symptoms were monitored without study - related treatment . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Thirty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">nine_2</font> <font color="red">subjects_2</font> <font color="red">completed_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">study_2</font> and were included in the data analysis . Following the relaxation - training intervention , the treatment group 's ( n   =   18 ) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as compared to the control group ( n   =   21 ) ( time by treatment interaction ) : anxiety levels decreased ( p   <   0.01 ) , QoL and mood improved ( p   <   0.05 ) , while levels of pain and stress decreased ( p   <   0.01 ) .
