<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with the favorable effect of pioglitazone on atheroma progression . 
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Diabetes_2</font> <font color="red">mellitus_2</font> is associated with accelerated coronary atheroma progression . Pioglitazone slowed progression compared with glimepiride in this population . 
<br> METHODS In all , <font color="red">360_2</font> <font color="red">diabetic_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">coronary_2</font> <font color="red">artery_2</font> <font color="red">disease_2</font> were treated with pioglitazone or glimepiride for 18 months in the PERISCOPE ( Pioglitazone Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation ) study . Coronary atheroma progression was evaluated by serial intravascular ultrasound . The relationship between changes in biochemical parameters , percent atheroma volume , and total atheroma volume was investigated . 
<br> RESULTS Pioglitazone - treated patients demonstrated greater increases in high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) and reductions in glycated hemoglobin , triglycerides , and C - reactive protein . Significant correlations were observed between changes in percent atheroma volume and triglycerides ( r = 0.15 , p = 0.04 ) , triglyceride / HDL - C ratio ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.03 ) , and glycated hemoglobin ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.03 ) with pioglitazone , and changes in low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( r = -0.15 , p = 0.05 ) , apolipoprotein B ( r = -0.16 , p = 0.04 ) , and apolipoprotein A - I ( r = -0.20 , p = 0.01 ) with glimepiride . Substantial atheroma regression , compared to progression , was associated with greater relative increases in HDL - C ( 14.2% vs. 7.8% , p = 0.04 ) , relative decreases in triglycerides ( -13.3% vs. -1.9% , p = 0.045 ) , triglyceride / HDL - C ratio ( -22.5 vs. -9.9% , p = 0.05 ) , and decrease in glycated hemoglobin ( -0.6% vs. -0.3% , p = 0.01 ) . Multivariable analysis revealed that pioglitazone - induced effects on triglyceride / HDL - C were associated with changes in percent atheroma volume ( p = 0.03 ) and total atheroma volume ( p = 0.02 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Favorable effects of pioglitazone on the triglyceride / HDL - C ratio correlated with delayed atheroma progression in <font color="red">diabetic_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> This finding highlights the potential importance of targeting atherogenic dyslipidemia in <font color="red">diabetic_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">coronary_2</font> <font color="red">artery_2</font> <font color="red">disease_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
