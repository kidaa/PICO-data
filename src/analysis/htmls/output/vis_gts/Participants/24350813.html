<br> OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long - term safety and efficacy of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">adolescents_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autistic_2</font> <font color="red">disorders_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS In this 6 month ( 26 week ) open - label extension ( OLE ) study , <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">5_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">17_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">age_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">completed_2</font> <font color="red">the_2</font> <font color="red">previous_2</font> <font color="red">fixed_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">dose_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">6_2</font> <font color="red">week_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">double_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">blind_2</font> <font color="red">[_2</font> <font color="red">DB_2</font> <font color="red">]_2</font> <font color="red">phase_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight . The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg / day for those weighing 20 to < 45 kg , and 1.75 mg / day for those weighing ≥ 45 kg . The study primarily assessed risperidone 's safety ; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end - point . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="red">Fifty_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">six_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">71%_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">out_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">79_1</font> <font color="red">enrolled_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">completed_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">OLE_1</font> <font color="red">;_1</font> the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response ( 7 [ 9% ] ) or adverse events ( AE ) ( 5 [ 6% ] ) . The most common ( ≥ 5% frequency in the total group ) AEs were increased appetite ( 11% [ n=9 ] ) ; increased weight and vomiting ( 9% [ n=7 ] each ) ; sedation , pyrexia , and upper respiratory tract infection ( 8% [ n=6 ] each ) ; nasopharyngitis ( 6% [ n=5 ] ) ; and somnolence and fatigue ( 5% [ n=4 ] each ) . Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 ( 8% ) patients . Increase in mean weight ( 11 - 15% ) and body mass index ( 5 - 10% ) occurred ; one patient discontinued because of weight increase . One potentially prolactin - related AE ( irregular menstruation ) was reported . The risperidone high - dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale ( 24.6 ) . All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS During this OLE , safety findings with risperidone treatment ( maximum weight - based dose of 1.25 mg / day or 1.75 mg / day ) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase , and with the current safety information for risperidone in <font color="red">autistic_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> psychiatric , and behavioral disorders . Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors .
