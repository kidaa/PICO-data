<br>
<br> BACKGROUND This study tested the hypothesis that , for <font color="red">colonoscopy_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> analgesia / sedation with remifentanil and propofol might be more effective compared with anesthesia by intravenous administration of midazolam , fentanyl , and propofol . 
<br> METHODS In a prospective , randomized trial , <font color="red">100_2</font> <font color="red">adult_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> received either conscious analgesia / sedation ( Sedation group ) or total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA group ) . Analgesia / sedation was achieved by infusion of remifentanil ( 0.20 to 0.25 microg / kg / min ) and propofol in titrated doses . TIVA was induced by intravenous administration of fentanyl ( 2 microg / kg ) , midazolam ( 0.05 mg / kg ) and propofol ( dosage titrated ) . Cardiorespiratory parameters and bispectral index were monitored and recorded . The quality of the analgesia was assessed with a Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NRS ) ; recovery level and return of psychomotor efficiency were evaluated with , respectively , the Aldrete scale and a Modified Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring ( MPADS ) system . 
<br> RESULTS Both groups of 50 patients were comparable with respect to demographic data , initial parameters , and duration of colonoscopy . All patients in the TIVA group found the colonoscopy painless ( NRS score 0 ) . In the Sedation group , the average pain intensity score was 0.4 ( 0.8 ) . There was a marked difference between the Sedation and TIVA groups with respect to the time from the end of the procedure until the maximum MPADS score was reached : respectively , -6.9 ( 4.0 ) versus 25.7 ( 8.4 ) minutes ( p < 0.001 ) . In the TIVA group , changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and signs of respiratory depression were significant ( p < 0.05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Combined administration of remifentanil and propofol for <font color="red">colonoscopy_1</font> provides sufficient analgesia , satisfactory hemodynamic stability , minor respiratory depression , and rapid recovery , and allows patients to be discharged approximately 15 minutes after the procedure .
