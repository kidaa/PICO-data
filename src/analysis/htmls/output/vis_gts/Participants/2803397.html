[ The sympatho - adrenergic stress reaction in <font color="red">ear_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> using various anesthesia technics ] . 
<br>
<br> The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various anaesthetic procedures on the endocrine stress responses during <font color="red">ear_2</font> <font color="red">microsurgical_2</font> <font color="red">operations_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Simple_1</font> <font color="red">mastoidectomies_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">radical_1</font> <font color="red">mastoidectomies_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">tympano_1</font> <font color="red">plastics_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">carried_1</font> <font color="red">out_1</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">49_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> under the following randomised anaesthetic procedures : Group 1 halothane anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin ( n = 14 ) , Group 2 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin ( n = 10 ) , Group 3 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine ( n = 14 ) , and Group 4 retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with prilocaine and epinephrine ( n = 14 ) . The plasma levels of epinephrine , norepinephrine , glucose , lactate and free glycerol were measured in addition to mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ) immediately before anaesthesia , 10 minutes after skin incision , 10 minutes after having started bone drilling , at the end of the operation and 3 hours after operation . All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor . Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia ( Groups 1 - 3 ) . Plasma catecholamines ( epinephrine and norepinephrine ) increased significantly in Group 4 ( retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia ) . There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR . The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose , lactate and free glycerol . The beneficial effect of general anaesthesia is documented by normal plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
