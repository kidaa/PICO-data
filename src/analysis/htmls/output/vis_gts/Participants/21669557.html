Intervention to lower household wood smoke exposure in Guatemala reduces ST - segment depression on electrocardiograms . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND A large body of evidence suggests that fine particulate matter ( PM ) air pollution is a cause of cardiovascular disease , but little is known in particular about the cardiovascular effects of indoor air pollution from household use of solid fuels in developing countries . RESPIRE ( Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects ) was a randomized trial of a chimney woodstove that reduces wood smoke exposure . 
<br> OBJECTIVES We tested the hypotheses that the stove intervention , compared with open fire use , would reduce ST - segment depression and increase heart rate variability ( HRV ) . 
<br> METHODS We used two complementary study designs : a ) between - groups comparisons based on randomized stove assignment , and b ) before - and - after comparisons within control subjects who used open fires during the trial and received chimney stoves after the trial . Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among <font color="red">49_1</font> <font color="red">intervention_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">70_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">women_1</font> <font color="red">38_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">84_1</font> <font color="red">years_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">age_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">55_1</font> <font color="red">control_1</font> <font color="red">subjects_1</font> were also assessed after receiving stoves . HRV and ST - segment values were assessed for each 30-min period . ST - segment depression was defined as an average value below -1.00 mm . Personal fine PM [ aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm ( PM₂.₅ ] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram . 
<br> RESULTS PM₂.₅ exposure means were 266 and 102 μg / m³ during the trial period in the control and intervention groups , respectively . During the trial , the stove intervention was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.08 - 0.90 ) for ST - segment depression . We found similar associations with the before - and - after comparison . The intervention was not significantly associated with HRV . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The stove intervention was associated with reduced occurrence of nonspecific ST - segment depression , suggesting that household wood smoke exposures affect ventricular repolarization and potentially cardiovascular health .
