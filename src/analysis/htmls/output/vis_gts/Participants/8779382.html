This effect was more marked if the epidural catheter was sited in the thoracic rather than the lumbar area . Sixty two percent ( n = 26 ) of tunnelled catheters remained within 0.5 cm of their original position compared to 38% ( n = 16 ) of non - tunnelled catheters , although this difference was not statistically significant . Outward catheter migration was not reduced by subcutaneous tunnelling .
