Methodology of serial ECG classification using an adaptation of the NOVACODE for Q wave myocardial infarction in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ( BARI ) . 
<br>
<br> Serial electrocardiographic ( ECG ) changes are a critical component of the diagnostic algorithm for classification of myocardial ischemic events in large - scale clinical trials . This study describes a computerized serial ECG classification program developed at the St. Louis University Core ECG Laboratory for use in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ( BARI ) trial , in which <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">multivessel_2</font> <font color="red">coronary_2</font> <font color="red">artery_2</font> <font color="red">disease_2</font> were randomized to receive either coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . The St. Louis University program detects and codes serial changes in Q , ST , and T wave items according to Minnesota code ( MC ) criteria using a modified NOVACODE hierarchical classification system . Measurements using a seven - power calibrated coding loupe are used to generate the MC from a customized software program . Significant minor or major changes are detected by the serial comparison program and referred to a physician coder for verification . Serial comparison coding rules are used to adjust for weaknesses in the standard MC classification system resulting from instability at decision boundaries . <font color="red">Of_1</font> <font color="red">4,244_1</font> <font color="red">BARI_1</font> <font color="red">randomized_1</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">registry_1</font> <font color="red">study_1</font> <font color="red">participants_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">follow_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">up_1</font> <font color="red">ECGs_1</font> <font color="red">received_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">Core_1</font> <font color="red">ECG_1</font> <font color="red">Laboratory_1</font> <font color="red">as_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">March_1</font> <font color="red">1995_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> a grade 2 MC Q wave progression was noted in 568 participants ( 13.4% ) using MC criteria alone , as compared with 367 ( 8.6% ) after the St. Louis University coding rules were applied . The incidence of grade 1 MC Q wave progressions was 16.4% ( 697/4,244 ) versus 6.1% ( 259/4,244 ) when the St. Louis University program was applied . Intraobserver variability for grade 2 Q wave progression codes determined from a sample of 812 serial .
