<br> In order to investigate the effect of anesthesia on serum parameters , <font color="red">Beluga_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">Huso_1</font> <font color="red">huso_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">L._1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> were blood - sampled immediately without anesthesia ( control ) or subjected to following anesthesia procedure : 40 , 120 , and 240 s exposure to 3,000 , 700 , and 500 mg l⁻¹ clove solution , respectively . Blood samples were collected after these periods , when <font color="red">fish_1</font> were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia . Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control . Serum lactate levels were significantly high in 500 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control group . Lactate levels were not significantly differed between control , 3,000 , and 700 mg l⁻¹ groups . There were no significant differences in serum levels of cholesterol , total protein , lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , Na⁺ , Cl⁻ , K⁺ , and Ca²⁺. Results suggest that rapid anesthesia with higher dose is better than slow anesthesia with lower dose for blood sampling in <font color="red">Beluga_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
