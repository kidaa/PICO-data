<br> INTRODUCTION <font color="red">Biventricular_1</font> <font color="red">pacing_1</font> <font color="red">system_1</font> <font color="red">implantation_1</font> is a time - consuming and challenging procedure . A critical step in biventricular pacemaker implantation is coronary sinus ( CS ) cannulation . CS cannulation can be achieved either using dedicated guiding catheters ( guiding catheter alone positioning strategy , GCA ) or with the aid of an electrophysiology catheter advanced inside the guiding catheter ( electrophysiology catheter aided positioning strategy , EPA ) . 
<br> AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate whether the EPA technique is useful for reducing CS cannulation time compared to a conventional GCA technique . 
<br> METHODS <font color="red">Thirty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">four_2</font> <font color="red">consecutive_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">randomly_1</font> <font color="red">assigned_1</font> to the GCA ( 18 patients ) or EPA ( 16 patients ) CS cannulation strategy . 
<br> RESULTS Time to successful catheterization of CS was 5.0 + /- 2.4 min in the EPA group versus 10.1 + /- 5.4 min in the GCA group p = 0.004 . Fluoroscopy time was 4.6 + /- 2.3 min in the EPA group versus 9.2 + /- 4.9 min in the GCA group p = 0.004 . Total contrast dye volume to search and engage the CS ostium was 0.0 ml in the EPA group versus 14.3 + /- 3.4 ml in the GCA group p < 0.001 . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Cannulation of CS with the adjunct of an electrophysiology catheter to dedicated delivery systems significantly reduces procedural time , fluoroscopy time and contrast dye volume compared to a conventional strategy .
