<br> OBJECTIVE Forceps biopsy is the standard method to obtain specimens in <font color="red">endoscopically_1</font> <font color="red">visible_1</font> <font color="red">lesions_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> It is common to combine forceps biopsy with cytology methods to increase the diagnostic yield . Although the flexible cryoprobe has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis , the obtained biopsies , called " cryobiopsies , " have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients . The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy .

Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens . We evaluated the safety and diagnostic yield to describe the feasibility of cryobiopsy . 
<br> RESULTS Comparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher diagnostic yield for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy ( 89.1% vs 65.5% , P < .05 ) . In this cohort , quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger biopsies regarding size and artifact - free tissue sections for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy ( P < .0001 ) . The overall diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy was 89.5% . Mild bleeding occurred in 11 cases ( 3.7% ) , moderate bleeding occurred in 3 cases ( 1.0% ) , and severe bleeding occurred in 1 case ( 0.3% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Cryobiopsy is safe and increases the diagnostic yield in <font color="red">endobronchial_1</font> <font color="red">tumor_1</font> <font color="red">lesions_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The method also is feasible under routine conditions .
