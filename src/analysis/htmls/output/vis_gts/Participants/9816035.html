<br>
<br> Amonafide is a new imide derivative of naphthalic acid . The drug had demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some activity in Phase I trials . The drug is extensively metabolized and detected in plasma and urine . Its toxicity has previously been correlated to the formation of an active metabolite , N - acetyl - amonafide . Amonafide was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) master metastatic breast cancer protocol . CALGB 8642 randomizes <font color="red">previously_2</font> <font color="red">untreated_2</font> <font color="red">metastatic_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by standard cyclophosphamide - doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil , or to immediate treatment with standard cyclophosphamide - doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil . The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival , toxicity , and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard chemotherapy . This report deals only with amonafide as a Phase II agent . Comparisons with the cyclophosphamide - doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil arm will not be addressed . <font color="red">Patients_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">to_2</font> <font color="red">have_2</font> <font color="red">histologically_2</font> <font color="red">documented_2</font> <font color="red">measurable_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">a_2</font> <font color="red">performance_2</font> <font color="red">status_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">0_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">1_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Patients_2</font> <font color="red">could_2</font> <font color="red">not_2</font> <font color="red">have_2</font> <font color="red">had_2</font> <font color="red">prior_2</font> <font color="red">chemotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">for_2</font> <font color="red">metastatic_2</font> <font color="red">disease_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Prior_2</font> <font color="red">adjuvant_2</font> <font color="red">chemotherapy_2</font> <font color="red">was_2</font> <font color="red">permitted_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Patients_2</font> <font color="red">could_2</font> <font color="red">not_2</font> <font color="red">have_2</font> <font color="red">visceral_2</font> <font color="red">crisis_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Amonafide was given at 300 mg / m2/day i.v . for 5 days , and repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles . Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof . Toxicity was primarily hematological and bimodal : 32% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia ; 22% had no leukopenia and 44% had no thrombocytopenia . The response rate was 18% , including one complete response . When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity , there was a 35.7% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 ( versus 8.3% , P = 0.08 ) . There was a 50% response if patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 ( versus 7.1% , P = < 0.01 ) . We conclude that amonafide is somewhat active in <font color="red">previously_2</font> <font color="red">untreated_2</font> <font color="red">breast_2</font> <font color="red">cancer_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> There may be a steep dose - response curve , based on the significant correlation between myelosuppression and response . Rates of responses in patients adequately dosed ( i.e. , with significant hematotoxicity ) with amonafide ranged from 35 to 50% . Further studies will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator phenotyping .
