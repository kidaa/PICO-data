Overall , the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups . There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups ; however , the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the cophenylcaine group . In linear regression , factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste . We conclude that the routine use of cophenylcaine for nasal preparation is not justified <font color="red">before_1</font> <font color="red">flexible_1</font> <font color="red">nasendoscopy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font>
