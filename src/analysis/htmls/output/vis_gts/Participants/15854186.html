<br> Practices vary across the UK on the use of topical preparation prior to <font color="red">flexible_1</font> <font color="red">fibreoptic_1</font> <font color="red">nasendoscopy_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> In this double - blind study , we randomised <font color="red">98_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> to receive cophenylcaine or placebo nasal spray before <font color="red">flexible_2</font> <font color="red">nasendoscopy_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> A visual analogue scale ( 1 - 100 ) was used to record pain , unpleasantness of taste and overall discomfort experienced . Overall , the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups . There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups ; however , the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the cophenylcaine group . In linear regression , factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste . We conclude that the routine use of cophenylcaine for nasal preparation is not justified before <font color="red">flexible_2</font> <font color="red">nasendoscopy_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
