After 1-week washout period 47 patients were randomized to ketazolam 15 mg , and 45 to placebo for 15 days ( first period ) . At the end of this period , if the patient experienced a decrease on the total Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM - A ) of at least 25% of basal value , the treatment was kept unchanged for a further 15 days , otherwise 15 mg of ketazolam were added to the previous treatment ( second period ) . Anxiety was rated after 2 and 4 weeks with the Italian HAM - A scale and with a 4-point scale ( patient 's assessment ) . Seventy - eight patients completed the first period and 75 the whole study . During the first period the percentage of responders was almost identical in both treatment groups , but during the second period a further slight improvement was observed in the early placebo responders , while the HAM - A score of patients on ketazolam continued to improve significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) throughout the study . Likewise a significant ( p less than 0.001 ) difference between treatments was observed , on the 4-point scale , in the population as a whole ( end of first period ) as well as in responder patients ( end second period ) . Tolerability was good , except in 1 patient on placebo , who was withdrawn from the study because of severe headache .
