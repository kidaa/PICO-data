<br> INTRODUCTION The aims of the present study were : ( a ) to examine the agreement between subjective ( assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ; IPAQ ) and objective ( accelerometry ; GT3X ) physical activity ( PA ) levels in <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">rheumatoid_1</font> <font color="red">arthritis_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">RA_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> and ( b ) to evaluate the associations of <font color="red">RA_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">'_1</font> subjective and objective PA to their scores on the maximal oxygen uptake test ( VO2max ) . 
<br> METHODS The participants wore the GT3X for seven days before completing the IPAQ and VO2max test . The Bland - Altman plot was used to illustrate the agreement between the objective and subjective PA data , and the Wilcoxon test was employed to examine the differences . The association between the PA measurement and VO2max test was examined via the correlations and the magnitude was presented by the Steiger 's Z value .

Smaller differences between the subjective and objective measures were found when PA was assessed at the moderate level . Wilcoxon tests revealed that patients reported less time spent engaged in sedentary behaviours ( Z=-6.80 , P<0.01 ) and light PA ( Z=-6.89 , P<0.01 ) and more moderate PA ( Z=-6.26 , P<0.01 ) than was objectively indicated . Significant positive correlations were revealed between VO2max with all PA levels derived from accelerometry ( light PA rho=.35 , P<.01 ; moderate PA rho=.34 , P=.01 ; moderate and vigorous PA , ( MVPA ) rho=.33 , P=.01 ) , and a negative association to sedentary time ( ST ) emerged ( rho=-.27 , P=.04 ) . IPAQ - reported moderate PA and MVPA positively correlated with maxV02 ( rho=.25 , P=.01 , rho=.27 , P=.01 , respectively ) . Differences between the magnitude of correlations between the IPAQ - VO2 max and GT3X - VO2 max were only significant for ST ( Z=3.43 , P<.01 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Via responses to the IPAQ , RA patients reported that they were less sedentary and engaged in more higher intensity PA than what was objectively assessed . Accelerometry data correlated with VO2max at all PA levels . Only subjective moderate and MPVA correlated with VO2max . Findings suggest that self - reported PA and ST should be interpreted with caution in <font color="red">people_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">RA_1</font> and complemented with accelerometry when possible .
