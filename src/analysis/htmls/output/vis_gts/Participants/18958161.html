Neural basis of self and other representation in <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">:_2</font> an FMRI study of self - face recognition . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="red">Autism_1</font> is a developmental disorder characterized by decreased interest and engagement in social interactions and by enhanced self - focus . While previous theoretical approaches to understanding autism have emphasized social impairments and altered interpersonal interactions , there is a recent shift towards understanding the nature of the representation of the self in <font color="red">individuals_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">autism_1</font> <font color="red">spectrum_1</font> <font color="red">disorders_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ASD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Still , the neural mechanisms subserving self - representations in <font color="red">ASD_1</font> are relatively unexplored . 
<br> METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used event - related fMRI to investigate brain responsiveness to images of the subjects ' own face and to faces of others . <font color="red">Children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> <font color="red">and_1</font> <font color="red">typically_1</font> <font color="red">developing_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">TD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> <font color="red">children_1</font> viewed randomly presented digital morphs between their own face and a gender - matched other face , and made " self / other " judgments . Both groups of children activated a right premotor / prefrontal system when identifying images containing a greater percentage of the self face . However , while TD children showed activation of this system during both self- and other - processing , children with ASD only recruited this system while viewing images containing mostly their own face . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE This functional dissociation between the representation of self versus others points to a potential neural substrate for the characteristic self - focus and decreased social understanding exhibited by these individuals , and suggests that <font color="red">individuals_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> lack the shared neural representations for self and others that <font color="red">TD_1</font> <font color="red">children_1</font> and adults possess and may use to understand others .
