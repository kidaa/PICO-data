<br> A new immunomodulating agent , bestatin ( INN : Ubenimex has low toxicity even after long - term oral administration and has significant modifications in immunological response . A cooperative randomized controlled study of bestatin immunotherapy in combination with remission maintenance chemotherapy for <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">acute_1</font> <font color="red">nonlymphocytic_1</font> <font color="red">leukemia_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">ANLL_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> was performed . After induction of complete remission , patients were randomized to the bestatin group ( 30 mg / bw per os ( po ) daily ) and the control group . The <font color="red">101_1</font> <font color="red">eligible_1</font> <font color="red">cases_1</font> ( bestatin : 48 , control : 53 ) were analyzed ; the bestatin group achieved longer remission than the control group and a statistically significant longer survival . Though this prolongation of remission was not significant in the bestatin group compared to the control group in the 15 - 49 yr age group , in the 50 - 65 yr age group it was significantly longer . Bestatin is shown to be a clinically useful drug for immunotherapy of <font color="red">adult_1</font> <font color="red">ANLL_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> since it has prolonged survival and remission especially in elderly patients , with few side - effects .
