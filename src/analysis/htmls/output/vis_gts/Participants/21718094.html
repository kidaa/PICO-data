<br> BACKGROUND In the interest of preserving residual insulin secretory capacity present at the time of diagnosis with <font color="red">type_2</font> <font color="red">1_2</font> <font color="red">diabetes_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">T1D_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> we compared the efficacy of starting insulin pump therapy at diagnosis with standard multiple daily insulin injections ( MDIs ) . 
<br> METHODS We conducted a prospective , randomized , pilot trial comparing MDI therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy ( pump therapy ) in <font color="red">24_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">8_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">18_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">old_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">newly_2</font> <font color="red">diagnosed_2</font> <font color="red">T1D._2</font> Subjects were evaluated at enrollment and 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1D. Preservation of insulin secretion , measured by mixed - meal - stimulated C - peptide secretion , was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment . Between - group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , continuous glucose sensor data , insulin utilization , anthropometric measures , and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points . 
<br> RESULTS Initiation of pump therapy within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed - meal tolerance test - stimulated C - peptide values at all time points , although these differences were not statistically significant . Nonetheless , improved glycemic control was observed in insulin pump - treated subjects ( more time spent with normoglycemia , better mean HbA1c ) , and pump - treated subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Initiation of insulin pump therapy at diagnosis improved glycemic control , was well tolerated , and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment . This study also suggests that earlier use of pump therapy might help to preserve residual β-cell function , although a larger clinical trial would be required to confirm this .
