Measurement of transfer factor during constant exhalation . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide ( TLCO ) was measured by a new method based on analysis of the ratio of the concentrations of carbon monoxide to an inert gas ( methane ) relative to lung volume during a constant exhalation . Since this new technique is based solely upon exhalation , anomalies associated with inspiration and breath holding do not affect results . Additionally , because prolonged breath holding is not required , measurements can readily be made in dyspnoeic patients . 
<br> METHODS Exhalation TLCO ( TLCO , ex ) was compared with the standard ( Jones and Meade ) 10 second breath holding TLCO ( TLCO , bh ) in <font color="red">100_2</font> <font color="red">consecutive_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> <font color="red">Patients_1</font> <font color="red">did_1</font> <font color="red">not_1</font> <font color="red">practise_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">exhalation_1</font> <font color="red">manoeuvre_1</font> <font color="red">prior_1</font> <font color="red">to_1</font> <font color="red">testing_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS The comparative results were very close ; mean difference ( bias ) + /- standard deviation ( precision ) was 0.05 ( 0.84 ) mmol / min / kPa . The relation was equally strong in patients with severe pulmonary disease ; for patients with FEV1 < 1.51 the mean difference was 0.21 ( 0.80 ) mmol / min / kPa . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Since the results were essentially identical between the techniques , it seems that comparable pathophysiological factors affect TLCO during breath holding and constant exhalation . Constant exhalation may therefore be a useful alternative to the breath holding technique for clinical measurement of TLCO .
