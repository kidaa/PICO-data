<br>
<br> This study reports results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at joint attention ( JA ) and symbolic play ( SP ) in <font color="red">preschool_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> with prediction to language outcome 12 months later . <font color="red">Participants_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">58_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">(_2</font> <font color="red">46_2</font> <font color="red">boys_2</font> <font color="red">)_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">between_2</font> <font color="red">3_2</font> <font color="red">and_2</font> <font color="red">4_2</font> <font color="red">years_2</font> <font color="red">of_2</font> <font color="red">age_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Children were randomized to a JA intervention , an SP intervention , or control group . Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5 - 6 weeks . Assessments of JA skills , SP skills , mother - child interactions , and language development were collected at 4 time points : pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers . Results indicate that expressive language gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group , and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated . For <font color="red">children_1</font> beginning treatment with the lowest language levels , the JA intervention improved language outcome significantly more than did the SP or control interventions . These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating JA and SP skills in <font color="red">young_2</font> <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
