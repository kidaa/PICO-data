<br>
<br> PURPOSE The effects of morphine on natural killer ( NK ) cell activity were investigated in <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">who_2</font> <font color="red">underwent_2</font> <font color="red">hysterectomy_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS <font color="red">Forty_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">divided_1</font> <font color="red">into_1</font> <font color="red">four_1</font> <font color="red">groups_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">ten_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The groups received intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine ( Group IT0.5 ) , intrathecal 0.1 mg morphine ( Group IT0.1 ) or 10 mg morphine i.v . ( Group IV ) . The <font color="red">remaining_1</font> <font color="red">ten_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">served_1</font> <font color="red">as_1</font> <font color="red">controls_1</font> and received inhalation anesthesia alone ( Group C ) . Blood samples were withdrawn before and two hours after surgery and on postoperative days one and two to determine the blood NK cell activity using a chromium release assay with K562 cells as targets , plasma catecholamines and cortisol levels . The postoperative pain score and side effects were studied in the four groups . 
<br> RESULTS In Group IT0.5 , the NK cell activity was lower on postoperative day 1 ( 23.9 + /- 8.4% ) than the baseline level ( 45.7 + /- 13% ) before surgery , and recovered on postoperative day 2 . In Groups IT0.1 , C and IV , the NK cell activities showed no significant changes . In all four groups , neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed . In all four groups , the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery , on postoperative days 1 and 2 . The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups . 
<br> CONCLUSION These results suggest that long - lasting analgesic effects of intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine suppress the immune response following <font color="red">abdominal_2</font> <font color="red">surgery_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font>
