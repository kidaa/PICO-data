Teacher and child predictors of achieving IEP goals of <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> It is encouraging that <font color="red">children_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">autism_2</font> show a strong response to early intervention , yet more research is needed for understanding the variability in responsiveness to specialized programs . Treatment predictor variables from 47 teachers and children who were randomized to receive the COMPASS intervention ( Ruble et al . in The collaborative model for promoting competence and success for <font color="red">students_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">ASD_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> Springer , New York , 2012a ) were analyzed . Predictors evaluated against child IEP goal attainment included child , teacher , intervention practice , and implementation practice variables based on an implementation science framework ( Dunst and Trivette in J Soc Sci 8:143 - 148 , 2012 ) . Findings revealed one child ( engagement ) , one teacher ( exhaustion ) , two intervention quality ( IEP quality for targeted and not targeted elements ) , and no implementation quality variables accounted for variance in child outcomes when analyzed separately . When the four significant variables were compared against each other in a single regression analysis , IEP quality accounted for one quarter of the variance in child outcomes .
