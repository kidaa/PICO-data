<br>
<br> Women who smoke and take <font color="red">oral_1</font> <font color="red">contraceptives_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">OCs_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease , but the exact mechanismsfor the increased risk are not known . Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one mechanism for the enhanced risk , but the small number of studies examining whether OC users who smoke have greater reactivity have produced mixed results . The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking , acute nicotine administration , and OC use on cardiovascular and lipid reactivity . <font color="red">Sixty_1</font> <font color="red">healthy_1</font> <font color="red">women_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">half_1</font> <font color="red">of_1</font> <font color="red">whom_1</font> <font color="red">had_1</font> <font color="red">been_1</font> <font color="red">using_1</font> <font color="red">OCs_1</font> <font color="red">for_1</font> <font color="red">at_1</font> <font color="red">least_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">previous_1</font> <font color="red">6_1</font> <font color="red">months_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> participated in the study . <font color="red">Approximately_1</font> <font color="red">two_1</font> <font color="red">thirds_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">smokers_1</font> and were randomized to be tested after either a 12-hr nicotine deprivation or administration of nicotine gum . <font color="red">One_1</font> <font color="red">third_1</font> <font color="red">were_1</font> <font color="red">nonsmokers_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Heart rate , blood pressure , and lipid measures were taken at rest , during a videotaped speech task , and during recovery from the task . Results indicated that , among OC nonusers , there was no effect of smoking status or nicotine administration on cardiovascular reactivity . However , among OC users , nonsmokers had significantly greater heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to stress . These data show that acute nicotine administration , in the form of nicotine gum , has no effect on cardiovascular or lipid stress reactivity in <font color="red">women_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> However OC use among nonsmoking women is associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress .
