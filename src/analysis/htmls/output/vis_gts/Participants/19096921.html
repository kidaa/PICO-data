<br>_1</font> This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week , randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured <font color="red">parent_1</font> <font color="red">training_1</font> would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance , irritability and adaptive functioning . In this model , medication reduces tantrums , aggression and self - injury ; <font color="red">parent_1</font> training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning . Thus , medication and parent training target related , but separate , outcomes . At week 24 , the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse . Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets . Thus , experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice .
