Fluoroscopic functional evaluation of <font color="red">bileaflet_1</font> <font color="red">prostheses_1</font> <font color="red">:_1</font> effect of different intraoperative valve orientation . 
<br>
<br> Fluoroscopy is a reliable , easy , and readily available technique to follow - up <font color="red">prosthesis_1</font> functioning after <font color="red">heart_1</font> <font color="red">valve_1</font> <font color="red">surgery_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The different orientation given to the <font color="red">prosthesis_1</font> may represent a limitation of the technique accounting for unsatisfactory results in 10% to 40% of the cases . The aim of the study was to evaluate whether and to what extent different intraoperative valve orientation influence feasibility and accuracy of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluation of <font color="red">bileaflet_1</font> <font color="red">prostheses_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> We prospectively evaluated <font color="red">90_1</font> <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">who_1</font> <font color="red">had_1</font> <font color="red">aortic_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">mitral_1</font> <font color="red">,_1</font> <font color="red">and/or_1</font> <font color="red">tricuspid_1</font> <font color="red">valve_1</font> <font color="red">replacement_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">Sorin_1</font> <font color="red">Bicarbon_1</font> <font color="red">or_1</font> <font color="red">CarboMedics_1</font> <font color="red">bileaflet_1</font> <font color="red">prostheses_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> Fifty percent of the patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive <font color="red">prostheses_1</font> oriented in a perpendicular or a parallel position with respect to the ventricular septum . Fluoroscopic evaluation was considered appropriate when the <font color="red">prosthesis_1</font> <font color="red">'_1</font> " tilting disk " projection was obtained . The valve 's hemodynamic performance was investigated through Doppler study . A proper fluoroscopic evaluation was rapidly ( 15 + /- 5 seconds ) achieved in all patients with the former orientation , whereas it was impossible to obtain it in 8 of 20 ( 40% ) , 19 of 20 ( 95% ) , and 4 of 5 ( 80% ) of patients with the latter orientation . In the remaining patients extremely angulated , uneasy projection was often required to get a correct fluoroscopic image . The Doppler study showed a similarly favorable hemodynamic performance regardless of valve orientation . <font color="red">Prosthesis_1</font> orientation crucially affects the rate of success of the fluoroscopic evaluation . The orientation perpendicular to the ventricular septum greatly facilitates the postoperative feasibility and accuracy of fluoroscopy , and it is not detrimental to the valve 's hemodynamic performance . This valve orientation may provide a better fluoroscopic window whenever a valve dysfunction is suspected .
