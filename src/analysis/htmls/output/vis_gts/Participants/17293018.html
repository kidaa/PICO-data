The safety of whey protein concentrate derived from the milk of cows immunized against Clostridium difficile . 
<br>
<br> A whey protein concentrate prepared from the milk of cows that have been immunized against Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) and its toxins , toxin A and toxin B , is produced for use as a medical food for the dietary management of <font color="red">patients_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">C._1</font> <font color="red">difficile_1</font> <font color="red">-_1</font> <font color="red">associated_1</font> <font color="red">diarrhea_1</font> <font color="red">(_1</font> <font color="red">CDAD_1</font> <font color="red">)_1</font> to prevent a relapse of the infection . The safety of anti - C. difficile whey protein concentrate ( anti - CD WPC ) is supported by analytical data comparing the composition of raw milk from immunized cows versus that from non - immunized cows , and the composition of anti - CD WPC versus that of regular whey protein concentrate . Additionally , a prospective clinical study was conducted in <font color="red">77_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">CDAD_2</font> to demonstrate the safety of consuming anti - CD WPC to prevent relapse of the infection . This study , which included adverse event monitoring , physical examinations , and extensive hematological and biochemical assessments , showed that anti - CD WPC is safe to consume by <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">CDAD_2</font> <font color="red">._2</font> The available analytical and clinical evidence demonstrate that anti - CD WPC is safe for use by <font color="red">individuals_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">CDAD_2</font> <font color="red">,_2</font> under the described conditions of use .
