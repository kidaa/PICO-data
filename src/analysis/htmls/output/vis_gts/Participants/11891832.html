Comparison of weakness progression in <font color="red">inclusion_1</font> <font color="red">body_1</font> <font color="red">myositis_1</font> during treatment with methotrexate or placebo . 
<br>
<br> We investigated whether 5 to 20 mg per week oral methotrexate could slow down disease progression in <font color="red">44_2</font> <font color="red">patients_2</font> <font color="red">with_2</font> <font color="red">inclusion_2</font> <font color="red">body_2</font> <font color="red">myositis_2</font> in a randomized double - blind placebo - controlled study over 48 weeks . Mean change of quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores was the primary study outcome measure . Quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores declined in both treatment groups , -0.2% for methotrexate and -3.4% for placebo ( 95% confidence interval = -2.5% to + 9.1% for difference ) . There were also no differences in manual muscle testing sum scores , activity scale scores and patients ' own assessments after 48 weeks of treatment . Serum creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in the methotrexate group . We conclude that oral methotrexate did not slow down progression of muscle weakness but decreased serum creatine kinase activity .
