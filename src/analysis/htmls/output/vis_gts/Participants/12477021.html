Clinical performance of the Reichert AT550 : a new non - contact tonometer . 
<br>
<br> The aim of the present study was to assess the level of accuracy for measurements of intra - ocular pressure ( IOP ) obtained with a new non - contact tonometer ( NCT ) the Reichert AT550 . Measurements were compared against those obtained with the Reichert Xpert Plus , Goldmann applanation tonometer and Perkins tonometer . <font color="red">Thirty_2</font> <font color="red">-_2</font> <font color="red">five_2</font> <font color="red">university_2</font> <font color="red">students_2</font> were assessed with the four tonometers in a randomised order , with non - contact tonometry performed first . Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer . Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained . No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the AT550 NCT with contact applanation tonometry ( AT ) ( p > 0.05 ) , displaying the closest level of agreement ( as represented by the lowest mean difference and the narrowest confidence interval ) with the Goldmann tonometer ( limits of agreement , 0.12+/-2.17 ) . In conclusion , readings of IOP with the AT550 NCT are clinically comparable with those obtained with Goldmann tonometry in a <font color="red">population_1</font> <font color="red">with_1</font> <font color="red">IOP_1</font> <font color="red">within_1</font> <font color="red">the_1</font> <font color="red">normal_1</font> <font color="red">range_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> <font color="red">
