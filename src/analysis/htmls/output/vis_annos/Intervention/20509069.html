<br>
<br> Pain following traumatic injuries is common , can impair injury recovery and is often inadequately treated . In particular , the role of <font color="blue">adjunctive_1</font> <font color="blue">nonpharmacologic_1</font> <font color="blue">analgesic_1</font> <font color="blue">techniques_1</font> is unclear . The authors report a randomized , controlled study of 21 hospitalized trauma patients to assess the analgesic efficacy of <font color="blue">virtual_2</font> <font color="blue">reality_2</font> <font color="blue">hypnosis_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">VRH)-hypnotic_2</font> <font color="blue">induction_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">analgesic_1</font> <font color="blue">suggestion_1</font> delivered by customized virtual reality ( VR ) hardware / software . Subjective pain ratings were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH ( used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care ) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone . VRH patients reported less pain intensity and less pain unpleasantness compared to control groups . These preliminary findings suggest that <font color="blue">VRH_1</font> <font color="blue">analgesia_1</font> is a novel technology worthy of further study , both to improve pain management and to increase availability of hypnotic analgesia to populations without access to therapist - provided hypnosis and suggestion .
