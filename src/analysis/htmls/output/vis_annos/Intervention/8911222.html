Effects of tryptophan depletion in drug - free adults with autistic disorder . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the behavioral and biochemical responses to acute <font color="blue">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="blue">depletion_1</font> in drug - free adult patients with autistic disorder . 
<br> METHODS Twenty drug - free adults with autistic disorder ( 16 men and 4 women ) ( mean [ + /- SD ] age , 30.5 + /- 8.5 years ) underwent <font color="blue">short_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">term_1</font> <font color="blue">tryptophan_3</font> <font color="blue">depletion_3</font> in a <font color="blue">double_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">blind_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">controlled_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">randomized_1</font> <font color="blue">crossover_1</font> <font color="blue">design_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Patients received a <font color="blue">24-hour_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">low_5</font> <font color="blue">-_5</font> <font color="blue">tryptophan_5</font> <font color="blue">diet_5</font> <font color="blue">followed_2</font> <font color="blue">the_2</font> <font color="blue">next_2</font> <font color="blue">morning_2</font> <font color="blue">by_2</font> <font color="blue">an_2</font> <font color="blue">amino_5</font> <font color="blue">acid_5</font> <font color="blue">drink_5</font> <font color="blue">._5</font> Behavioral ratings were obtained on the morning of the <font color="blue">amino_2</font> <font color="blue">acid_2</font> <font color="blue">drink_2</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">baseline_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">180_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">300_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">420_1</font> <font color="blue">minutes_1</font> <font color="blue">after_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">drink_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Plasma free and total tryptophan levels were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink . The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days . 
<br> RESULTS Eleven ( 65% ) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of behavioral symptoms with short - term tryptophan depletion , but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in clinical status from baseline after <font color="blue">sham_1</font> <font color="blue">depletion_1</font> ( P = .001 ) . <font color="blue">Tryptophan_1</font> <font color="blue">depletion_1</font> led to a significant increase in behaviors such as whirling , flapping , pacing , banging and hitting self , rocking , and toe walking ( P < .05 ) . In addition , patients were significantly less calm and happy and more anxious . No significant change was observed in social relatedness or repetitive thoughts and behavior . Plasma total and free tryptophan levels were reduced 86% and 69% , respectively , 5 hours after the <font color="blue">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">deficient_1</font> <font color="blue">amino_1</font> <font color="blue">acid_1</font> <font color="blue">drink_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline plasma total tryptophan levels ( P < .001 ) and Autism Behavior Checklist scores ( P = .005 ) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after <font color="blue">tryptophan_1</font> <font color="blue">depletion_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism . These data suggest that the short - term <font color="blue">reduction_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">serotonin_1</font> <font color="blue">precursor_1</font> <font color="blue">availability_1</font> may exacerbate some symptoms characteristic of autism in some patients . Continued investigation into the role of serotonin in the <font color="blue">pathogenesis_1</font> and <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> of autistic disorder is warranted .
