<br>
<br> PURPOSE The effects of <font color="blue">morphine_2</font> on natural killer ( NK ) cell activity were investigated in patients who underwent <font color="blue">hysterectomy_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br> METHODS Forty patients were divided into four groups of ten . The groups received <font color="blue">intrathecal_3</font> <font color="blue">0.5_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">morphine_4</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">Group_1</font> <font color="blue">IT0.5_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">intrathecal_2</font> <font color="blue">0.1_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">morphine_3</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">Group_1</font> <font color="blue">IT0.1_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">10_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">morphine_4</font> <font color="blue">i.v_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> ( Group IV ) . The remaining ten patients served as <font color="blue">controls_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">received_1</font> <font color="blue">inhalation_2</font> <font color="blue">anesthesia_3</font> <font color="blue">alone_2</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">Group_1</font> C ) . Blood samples were withdrawn before and two hours after <font color="blue">surgery_1</font> and on postoperative days one and two to determine the blood NK cell activity using a chromium release assay with K562 cells as targets , plasma catecholamines and cortisol levels . The postoperative pain score and side effects were studied in the four groups . 
<br> RESULTS In Group IT0.5 , the NK cell activity was lower on postoperative day 1 ( 23.9 + /- 8.4% ) than the baseline level ( 45.7 + /- 13% ) before <font color="blue">surgery_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and recovered on postoperative day 2 . In Groups IT0.1 , C and IV , the NK cell activities showed no significant changes . In all four groups , neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed . In all four groups , the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery , on postoperative days 1 and 2 . The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups . 
<br> CONCLUSION These results suggest that <font color="blue">long_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">lasting_1</font> <font color="blue">analgesic_2</font> effects of <font color="blue">intrathecal_1</font> 0.5 mg <font color="blue">morphine_1</font> suppress the immune response following <font color="blue">abdominal_1</font> <font color="blue">surgery_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
