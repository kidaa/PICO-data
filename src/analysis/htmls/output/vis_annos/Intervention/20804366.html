<br> OBJECTIVE We aim to study the efficacy of <font color="blue">acupuncture_2</font> <font color="blue">versus_2</font> <font color="blue">sham_2</font> <font color="blue">acupuncture_2</font> in children with autism spectrum disorder . 
<br> METHODS A single - blind randomized control trial was conducted in 50 children . These children were randomly assigned to the treatment group with <font color="blue">tongue_5</font> <font color="blue">acupuncture_5</font> ( 40 sessions over 8 weeks ) <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">control_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">sham_4</font> <font color="blue">tongue_4</font> <font color="blue">acupuncture_4</font> <font color="blue">to_4</font> <font color="blue">nonacupoints_4</font> <font color="blue">in_4</font> <font color="blue">the_4</font> <font color="blue">tongue_4</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS There was improvement in both the treatment and control groups in all assessed measures but more so in the treatment than in the control group : ( 1 ) eye - hand coordination , performance , and practical reasoning of Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale ; ( 2 ) sensory - motor , social , affectual , language , and total score of Ritvo - Freeman Real Life Scale ; ( 3 ) Comprehension Language age in the Reynell Language Developmental Scale ; and ( 4 ) Total Score and Mental Age in Symbolic Play Test . The only statistically significant improvement in the treatment as compared to the control group was seen in self - care and cognition domains of the Functional Independence Measure for children . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS We had demonstrated that a short course of <font color="blue">acupuncture_1</font> had efficacy in improving various developmental and behavioral aspects of children with autism . The long - term efficacy in functional gain needs to be further explored .
