<br> This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week , randomized trial designed to test whether <font color="blue">risperidone_6</font> <font color="blue">plus_5</font> <font color="blue">structured_5</font> <font color="blue">parent_6</font> <font color="blue">training_6</font> <font color="blue">would_1</font> <font color="blue">be_1</font> <font color="blue">superior_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">risperidone_5</font> <font color="blue">only_1</font> on measures of noncompliance , irritability and adaptive functioning . In this model , medication reduces tantrums , aggression and self - injury ; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning . Thus , medication and parent training target related , but separate , outcomes . At week 24 , the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse . Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets . Thus , experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of <font color="blue">combining_1</font> <font color="blue">pharmacotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">exportable_1</font> <font color="blue">behavioral_1</font> <font color="blue">interventions_1</font> is needed to guide clinical practice .
