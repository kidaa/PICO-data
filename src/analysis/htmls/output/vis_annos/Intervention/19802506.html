<br> SUMMARY This study examined whether 24 months of <font color="blue">weight_3</font> <font color="blue">training_3</font> <font color="blue">exercises_3</font> <font color="blue">enhanced_1</font> the effectiveness of <font color="blue">risedronate_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">calcium_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and <font color="blue">vitamin_1</font> <font color="blue">D_1</font> in maintaining or improving bone mineral density ( BMD ) in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors . Subjects who were > or = 50% adherent to <font color="blue">exercise_1</font> had no improvement in BMD but were less likely to lose BMD . 
<br> INTRODUCTION This study examined whether ( 1 ) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors ( BCS ) with bone loss taking 24 months of <font color="blue">risedronate_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">calcium_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">vitamin_1</font> <font color="blue">D_1</font> had increased bone mineral density ( BMD ) at the total hip , femoral neck , L1-L4 spine , total radius and 33% radius , and decreased bone turnover ; ( 2 ) subjects who also participated in <font color="blue">strength_2</font> <font color="blue">/_2</font> <font color="blue">weight_2</font> <font color="blue">training_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">ST_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> <font color="blue">exercises_2</font> had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover ; and ( 3 ) subjects who also <font color="blue">exercised_1</font> were more likely to preserve ( at least maintain ) BMD . 
<br> METHODS Postmenopausal BCS ( 223 ) were randomly assigned to <font color="blue">exercise_2</font> <font color="blue">plus_2</font> <font color="blue">medication_2</font> or <font color="blue">medication_1</font> <font color="blue">only_1</font> groups . Both groups received 24 months of <font color="blue">1,200_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">calcium_5</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">400_2</font> <font color="blue">IU_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">vitamin_6</font> <font color="blue">D_6</font> <font color="blue">daily_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">35_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">risedronate_5</font> <font color="blue">weekly_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> and the <font color="blue">exercise_2</font> group additionally had <font color="blue">ST_5</font> <font color="blue">exercises_5</font> <font color="blue">twice_2</font> <font color="blue">weekly_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br> RESULTS After 24 months , women who took <font color="blue">medications_2</font> <font color="blue">without_2</font> <font color="blue">exercising_2</font> had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip ( + 1.81% ) and spine ( + 2.85% ) and significant decreases in Alkphase B ( -8.7% ) and serum NTx ( -16.7% ) . Women <font color="blue">who_1</font> <font color="blue">also_1</font> <font color="blue">exercised_2</font> had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck ( + 0.29% ) , total hip ( + 0.34% ) , spine ( + 0.23% ) , total radius ( + 0.30% ) , and additional decreases in Alkphase B ( -2.4% ) and Serum NTx ( -6.5% ) . Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with <font color="blue">exercise_1</font> were not significant . Subjects who were > or = 50% adherent to <font color="blue">exercise_1</font> were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.66 , p = 0.03 ) and femoral neck ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.63 , p = 0.03 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="blue">Strength_2</font> <font color="blue">/_2</font> <font color="blue">weight_2</font> <font color="blue">training_2</font> <font color="blue">exercises_2</font> may prevent loss of BMD in postmenopausal BCS at risk for bone loss .
