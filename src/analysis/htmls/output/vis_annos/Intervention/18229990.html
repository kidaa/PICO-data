<br> This study reports results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at <font color="blue">joint_4</font> <font color="blue">attention_4</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">JA_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">and_3</font> <font color="blue">symbolic_4</font> <font color="blue">play_4</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">SP_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> in preschool children with autism , with prediction to language outcome 12 months later . Participants were 58 children ( 46 boys ) with autism between 3 and 4 years of age . Children were randomized to a <font color="blue">JA_2</font> <font color="blue">intervention_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">an_2</font> <font color="blue">SP_2</font> <font color="blue">intervention_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">control_2</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5 - 6 weeks . Assessments of <font color="blue">JA_2</font> <font color="blue">skills_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">SP_2</font> <font color="blue">skills_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">mother_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">child_1</font> <font color="blue">interactions_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">language_1</font> <font color="blue">development_1</font> were collected at 4 time points : pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers . Results indicate that expressive language gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group , and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated . For children beginning treatment with the lowest language levels , the <font color="blue">JA_2</font> <font color="blue">intervention_1</font> improved language outcome significantly more than did the <font color="blue">SP_1</font> or control interventions . These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating <font color="blue">JA_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">SP_2</font> <font color="blue">skills_1</font> in young children with autism .
