<br> OBJECTIVE To develop a cycle - based risk prediction model for neutropenic complications ( NC ) during <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">doxorubicin_5</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">DOX_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">pegylated_4</font> <font color="blue">liposomal_4</font> <font color="blue">formulation_4</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">PLD_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> for patients with metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . 
<br> METHODS Data analyzed was from a phase III , randomized clinical trial of <font color="blue">DOX_2</font> ( 60 mg / m(2 ) every 3 weeks ) <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">PLD_2</font> ( 50 mg / m(2 ) every 4 weeks ) for the first line therapy for MBC ( n = 509 ) ( O'Brien et al , Ann Oncol . 2004;15:440 - 449 ) . NC were defined as an absolute neutrophil count < or = 1.5 x 10(9 ) cells / L ( ie , > or = grade II ) before the next cycle , febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with a documented infection . Patient and hematologic factors potentially associated with NC were evaluated . Factors with a P value of < or = 0.25 within a cycle were included in a generalized estimating equations regression model . Using backward elimination , we derived a risk scoring algorithm ( range 0 - 63 ) from the final reduced model . 
<br> RESULTS Risk factors retained in the model included poor performance status , absolute neutrophil count < or = 2.0 x 10(9 ) cells / L in the previous cycle , the first cycle of chemotherapy , <font color="blue">DOX_1</font> versus <font color="blue">PLD_1</font> and advanced age . A precycle risk score from > or = 25 to < 40 for a given patient was identified as being the optimal threshold for sensitivity ( 58.0% ) and specificity ( 78.7% ) . Patients with a score at or beyond this threshold would be considered at high risk for developing NC in later cycles . 
<br> CONCLUSION The use of this model may enhance patient care by targeting preventative therapies ( eg , granulocyte colony stimulating factor or PLD ) to those MBC patients most likely to experience NC during anthracycline - based chemotherapy .
