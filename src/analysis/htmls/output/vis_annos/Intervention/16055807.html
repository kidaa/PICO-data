<br>
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">Early_1</font> <font color="blue">Detection_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">Intervention_1</font> <font color="blue">Programme_1</font> of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia ( GRNS ) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach . Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large - scale multicentre projects . 
<br> AIMS To present the concept of the intervention studies , and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure . 
<br> METHOD <font color="blue">Comprehensive_3</font> <font color="blue">cognitive_5</font> <font color="blue">-_5</font> <font color="blue">behavioural_5</font> <font color="blue">therapy_5</font> has been developed for patients in the " early initial prodromal state " . For patients in the " late initial prodromal state " the <font color="blue">atypical_2</font> <font color="blue">neuroleptic_3</font> <font color="blue">amisulpride_4</font> is explored . Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition . 
<br> RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003 , 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres . More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 ( 48.5% ) gave informed consent to participate in the trials . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis .
