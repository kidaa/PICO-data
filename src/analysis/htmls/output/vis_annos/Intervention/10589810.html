Clinical effects of <font color="blue">root_1</font> <font color="blue">instrumentation_1</font> using conventional steel or non - tooth substance removing plastic curettes during supportive periodontal therapy ( SPT ) . 
<br>
<br> Although <font color="blue">root_1</font> <font color="blue">instrumentation_1</font> has been accepted as the most important cause - related treatment of periodontal diseases , repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth . In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy , non - root substance removing curettes have been developed . However , the clinical effects of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established . The aims of this study were , therefore , to compare the effects of <font color="blue">root_1</font> <font color="blue">instrumentation_1</font> <font color="blue">using_1</font> <font color="blue">plastic_1</font> <font color="blue">curettes_1</font> ( Universal Perio Soft Scaler , Hawe - Neos Dental , Bioggio , TI , Switzerland ) versus <font color="blue">conventional_1</font> <font color="blue">steel_1</font> <font color="blue">curettes_1</font> on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy . 40 subjects participated in this parallel , randomized , double blind , prospective longitudinal clinical study following <font color="blue">active_1</font> <font color="blue">peridontal_1</font> <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 20 subjects served as a <font color="blue">control_2</font> <font color="blue">group_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">were_1</font> <font color="blue">treated_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">conventional_4</font> <font color="blue">steel_4</font> <font color="blue">curettes_4</font> <font color="blue">during_1</font> <font color="blue">a_1</font> <font color="blue">supportive_1</font> <font color="blue">periodontal_1</font> <font color="blue">care_1</font> <font color="blue">visit_1</font> ( SPT ) . The other 20 subjects , the <font color="blue">experimental_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">were_1</font> <font color="blue">treated_1</font> <font color="blue">using_1</font> <font color="blue">plastic_3</font> <font color="blue">curettes_3</font> during a similar SPT visit . Clinical parameters , such as bleeding on probing ( BOP ) and probing pocket depth ( PPD ) , were assessed at baseline and 3 - 6 months later at the next regular SPT visit . In addition , the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline . The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time . Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17 - 42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days ( mean BOP baseline : 26% , mean BOP after 10 days : 16% ) . This clinical study suggests that <font color="blue">non_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">root_1</font> <font color="blue">substance_1</font> <font color="blue">removing_1</font> <font color="blue">curettes_1</font> may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care , thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth .
