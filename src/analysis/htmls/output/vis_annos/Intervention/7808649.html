<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg and 30 mg suppositories in comparison to <font color="blue">placebo_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> after single dose administration in patients suffering from post - operative pain after cholecystectomy . 
<br> DESIGN Double - blind , randomized , controlled study . 
<br> SETTING Anaesthesia Service . 
<br> PATIENTS 99 patients with severe pain following surgery .

At the end of the treatment period overall assessment of safety and efficacy were recorded by physician and patient . The results show that in both active groups after 30 ' and until 4 hours , pain intensity decreased significantly with respect to the baseline . However a statistically significant difference between groups of p < 0.02 , p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 was found in favour of the 30 mg dose respectively at 30 ' , 6 and 8 hours after administration . All the patients treated with placebo suppositories required another rescue analgesic drug and withdrew from the trial . Three patients complained adverse events not related to treatment : two on placebo and one on ketorolac 10 mg . The systemic and local tolerability of the drug was good . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS This study shows that ketorolac 30 mg suppositories are effective in clinical conditions , such as after surgery , in which pain control must be achieved within the shortest time interval and maintained or improved by means of a single route of administration .
