Psychological mediators of <font color="blue">bupropion_4</font> <font color="blue">sustained_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">release_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> for smoking cessation . 
<br>
<br> AIM The study aimed to test simultaneously our understanding of the effects of <font color="blue">bupropion_3</font> <font color="blue">sustained_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">release_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">SR_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> on putative mediators and our understanding of determinants of post - quit abstinence , including withdrawal distress , cigarette craving , positive affect and subjective reactions to cigarettes smoked during a lapse . The specificity of <font color="blue">bupropion_3</font> <font color="blue">SR_2</font> effects was also tested in exploratory analyses . 
<br> DESIGN Data from a randomized , <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">controlled_1</font> clinical trial of <font color="blue">bupropion_1</font> <font color="blue">SR_1</font> were submitted to mediation analyses . 
<br> SETTING Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention , Madison , WI , USA . 
<br> PARTICIPANTS A total of 403 adult , daily smokers without contraindications to <font color="blue">bupropion_1</font> <font color="blue">SR_1</font> use . 
<br> INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a <font color="blue">9-week_1</font> <font color="blue">course_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">bupropion_5</font> <font color="blue">SR_4</font> <font color="blue">or_4</font> <font color="blue">placebo_5</font> <font color="blue">pill_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">receive_1</font> <font color="blue">eight_2</font> <font color="blue">brief_2</font> <font color="blue">individual_2</font> <font color="blue">counseling_2</font> <font color="blue">sessions_2</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">no_2</font> <font color="blue">counseling_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br> MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post - quit . 
<br> FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short - term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette , but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect . <font color="blue">Bupropion_2</font> <font color="blue">SR_1</font> effects on point - prevalence abstinence at 1 month post - quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self - efficacy . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of <font color="blue">bupropion_2</font> <font color="blue">SR_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy .
