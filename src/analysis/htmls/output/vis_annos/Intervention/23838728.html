<br> It is encouraging that children with autism show a strong response to early intervention , yet more research is needed for understanding the variability in responsiveness to specialized programs . <font color="blue">Treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">predictor_1</font> variables from 47 teachers and children who were randomized to receive the <font color="blue">COMPASS_4</font> <font color="blue">intervention_4</font> ( Ruble et al . in The collaborative model for promoting competence and success for students with ASD . Springer , New York , 2012a ) were analyzed . Predictors evaluated against child <font color="blue">IEP_1</font> <font color="blue">goal_1</font> attainment included child , teacher , intervention practice , and <font color="blue">implementation_1</font> <font color="blue">practice_1</font> <font color="blue">variables_1</font> based on an implementation science framework ( Dunst and Trivette in J Soc Sci 8:143 - 148 , 2012 ) . Findings revealed one child ( engagement ) , one teacher ( exhaustion ) , two intervention quality <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">IEP_1</font> quality for targeted and not targeted elements ) , and no implementation quality variables accounted for variance in child outcomes when analyzed separately . When the four significant variables were compared against each other in a single regression analysis , <font color="blue">IEP_2</font> <font color="blue">quality_1</font> accounted for one quarter of the variance in child outcomes .
