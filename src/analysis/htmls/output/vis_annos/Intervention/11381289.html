<br> The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ( HOPE ) study was important because it showed the benefits of <font color="blue">ramipril_4</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">an_1</font> <font color="blue">angiotensin_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">converting_1</font> <font color="blue">enzyme_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">ACE_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">inhibitor_1</font> - in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events . Treatment with <font color="blue">ramipril_3</font> significantly reduced the rates of death , myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary revascularization , cardiac arrest and heart failure , as well as the risk of diabetes - related complications and of diabetes itself . The effects of <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">vitamin_2</font> <font color="blue">E_2</font> were also evaluated , but no statistical benefits were shown .
