Raising high - density lipoprotein in humans through inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein : an initial multidose study of <font color="blue">torcetrapib_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE The ability of the potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) inhibitor <font color="blue">torcetrapib_3</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">CP-529,414_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> to raise high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) levels in healthy young subjects was tested in this initial phase 1 multidose study . 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS Five groups of 8 subjects each were randomized to <font color="blue">placebo_4</font> ( n=2 ) <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">torcetrapib_4</font> ( n=6 ) at 10 , 30 , 60 , and 120 mg daily and 120 mg twice daily for 14 days . <font color="blue">Torcetrapib_3</font> was well tolerated , with all treated subjects completing the study . The correlation of plasma drug levels with inhibition ( EC50=43 nM ) was as expected based on in vitro potency ( IC50 approximately 50 nM ) , and increases in CETP mass were consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition . CETP inhibition increased with escalating dose , leading to elevations of HDL - C of 16% to 91% . Total plasma cholesterol did not change significantly because of a reduction in nonHDL - C , including a 21% to 42% lowering of low - density lipoprotein cholesterol at the higher doses . Apolipoprotein A - I and E were elevated 27% and 66% , respectively , and apoB was reduced 26% with 120 mg twice daily . Cholesteryl ester content decreased and triglyceride increased in the nonHDL plasma fraction , with contrasting changes occurring in HDL . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS These effects of CETP inhibition resemble those observed in partial CETP deficiency . This work serves as a prelude to further studies in subjects with low HDL , or combinations of dyslipidemia , in assessing the role of CETP in atherosclerosis .
