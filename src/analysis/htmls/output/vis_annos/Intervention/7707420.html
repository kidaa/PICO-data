Effects of <font color="blue">individualized_3</font> <font color="blue">breast_3</font> <font color="blue">cancer_3</font> <font color="blue">risk_3</font> <font color="blue">counseling_3</font> <font color="blue">:_3</font> a randomized trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Studies have shown that a majority of women with a family history of breast cancer have exaggerated perceptions of their own risk of this disease and experience excessive anxiety . In response to the need to communicate more accurate risk information to these women , specialized programs for <font color="blue">breast_1</font> <font color="blue">cancer_1</font> <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">counseling_1</font> have been initiated in medical centers across the United States . 
<br> PURPOSE Our purpose was 1 ) to evaluate the impact of a standardized protocol for <font color="blue">individualized_1</font> <font color="blue">breast_1</font> <font color="blue">cancer_1</font> <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">counseling_1</font> on comprehension of personal risk among first - degree relatives of index breast cancer patients and 2 ) to identify women most and least likely to benefit from such <font color="blue">counseling_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS This study is a prospective randomized trial <font color="blue">comparing_2</font> <font color="blue">individualized_3</font> <font color="blue">breast_4</font> <font color="blue">cancer_4</font> <font color="blue">risk_4</font> <font color="blue">counseling_4</font> <font color="blue">to_2</font> <font color="blue">general_5</font> <font color="blue">health_5</font> <font color="blue">counseling_5</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">control_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> We studied 200 women aged 35 years and older who had a family history of breast cancer in a first - degree relative . Women with a personal history of cancer were excluded . <font color="blue">Risk_1</font> <font color="blue">comprehension_1</font> <font color="blue">was_1</font> <font color="blue">assessed_1</font> <font color="blue">as_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">concordance_1</font> <font color="blue">between_1</font> <font color="blue">perceived_1</font> <font color="blue">"_1</font> <font color="blue">subjective_1</font> <font color="blue">"_1</font> <font color="blue">lifetime_1</font> <font color="blue">breast_1</font> <font color="blue">cancer_1</font> <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">estimated_1</font> <font color="blue">"_1</font> <font color="blue">objective_1</font> <font color="blue">"_1</font> <font color="blue">lifetime_1</font> <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> <font color="blue">
<br>_1</font> RESULTS The results of <font color="blue">logistic_1</font> <font color="blue">regression_1</font> <font color="blue">analysis_1</font> showed that women who received <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">counseling_1</font> were significantly more likely to improve their risk comprehension , compared with women in the control condition ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.5 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.3 - 9.5 ; P = .01 ) . However , in both groups , about two thirds of women continued to overestimate their lifetime risks substantially following <font color="blue">counseling_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Examination of subjects by treatment interaction effects indicated that <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">counseling_1</font> did not produce improved comprehension among the large proportion of women who had high levels of anxious preoccupation with breast cancer at base line ( P = .02 ) . In addition , white women were less likely to benefit than African - American women ( OR = 0.34 ; 95% CI = 0.11 - 0.99 ; P = .05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Efforts to counsel women about their breast cancer risks are not likely to be effective unless their breast cancer anxieties are also addressed . 
<br> IMPLICATIONS Attention to the psychological aspects of breast cancer risk will be critical in the development of <font color="blue">risk_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">counseling_2</font> <font color="blue">programs_2</font> <font color="blue">that_1</font> <font color="blue">incorporate_1</font> <font color="blue">testing_1</font> <font color="blue">for_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">recently_1</font> <font color="blue">cloned_1</font> <font color="blue">breast_1</font> <font color="blue">cancer_1</font> <font color="blue">susceptibility_1</font> <font color="blue">gene_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">BRCA1_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">BRCA2_1</font> <font color="blue">when_1</font> <font color="blue">that_1</font> <font color="blue">gene_1</font> <font color="blue">has_1</font> <font color="blue">also_1</font> <font color="blue">been_1</font> <font color="blue">cloned_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
