<br>_1</font> The aim of the present study was to assess the level of accuracy for measurements of intra - ocular pressure ( IOP ) obtained with a <font color="blue">new_1</font> <font color="blue">non_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">contact_2</font> <font color="blue">tonometer_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">NCT_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">Reichert_1</font> <font color="blue">AT550_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Measurements were compared against those obtained with the <font color="blue">Reichert_3</font> <font color="blue">Xpert_3</font> <font color="blue">Plus_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">Goldmann_3</font> <font color="blue">applanation_3</font> <font color="blue">tonometer_3</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">Perkins_3</font> <font color="blue">tonometer_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> Thirty - five university students were assessed with the four tonometers in a randomised order , with non - contact tonometry performed first . Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer . Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained . No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the <font color="blue">AT550_1</font> <font color="blue">NCT_1</font> with <font color="blue">contact_1</font> <font color="blue">applanation_2</font> <font color="blue">tonometry_2</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">AT_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> ( p > 0.05 ) , displaying the closest level of agreement ( as represented by the lowest mean difference and the narrowest confidence interval ) with the <font color="blue">Goldmann_2</font> <font color="blue">tonometer_2</font> ( limits of agreement , 0.12+/-2.17 ) . In conclusion , readings of IOP with the <font color="blue">AT550_1</font> <font color="blue">NCT_1</font> are clinically comparable with those obtained with <font color="blue">Goldmann_1</font> <font color="blue">tonometry_1</font> in a population with IOP within the normal range .
