<font color="blue">Amonafide_3</font> <font color="blue">:_3</font> An active agent in the treatment of previously untreated advanced breast cancer -- a cancer and leukemia group B study ( CALGB 8642 ) . 
<br>
<br> <font color="blue">Amonafide_2</font> is a new imide derivative of naphthalic acid . The drug had demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some activity in Phase I trials . The drug is extensively metabolized and detected in plasma and urine . Its toxicity has previously been correlated to the formation of an active metabolite , N - acetyl - amonafide . <font color="blue">Amonafide_2</font> was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) master metastatic breast cancer protocol . CALGB 8642 randomizes previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by <font color="blue">standard_2</font> <font color="blue">cyclophosphamide_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">immediate_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">standard_2</font> <font color="blue">cyclophosphamide_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil_3</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival , toxicity , and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> This report deals only with <font color="blue">amonafide_1</font> as a Phase II agent . Comparisons with the <font color="blue">cyclophosphamide_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil_1</font> arm will not be addressed . Patients had to have histologically documented measurable breast cancer and a performance status of 0 - 1 . Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease . Prior adjuvant <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> was permitted . Patients could not have visceral crisis . <font color="blue">Amonafide_3</font> was given at 300 mg / m2/day i.v . for 5 days , and repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles . Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof . Toxicity was primarily hematological and bimodal : 32% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia ; 22% had no leukopenia and 44% had no thrombocytopenia . The response rate was 18% , including one complete response . When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity , there was a 35.7% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 ( versus 8.3% , P = 0.08 ) . There was a 50% response if patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 ( versus 7.1% , P = < 0.01 ) . We conclude that <font color="blue">amonafide_1</font> is somewhat active in previously untreated breast cancer patients . There may be a steep dose - response curve , based on the significant correlation between myelosuppression and response . Rates of responses in patients adequately dosed ( i.e. , with significant hematotoxicity ) with amonafide ranged from 35 to 50% . Further studies will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator phenotyping .
