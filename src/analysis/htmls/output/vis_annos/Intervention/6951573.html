<br> One hundred and twenty patients presenting at Macquarie Hospital for admission were randomly allocated into two groups .

Initially , the burden on the relatives of the project group was higher , but by one month it was somewhat lower and by four months it was significantly lower than the burden on the control group relatives . Relatives of the project group patients were significantly more satisfied with the treatment than control group relatives . It is clearly feasible to treat most psychiatric patients in the community without increasing the burden on their relatives .
