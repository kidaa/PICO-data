The effect of administered drug was determined by comparsion of values of red blood count recovered before the treatment , 2nd or 3rd day post administration and two weeks later . The serum values of soluble transferrin receptors and ferritin were observed as markers of iron cell saturation and body iron reserves , too . Integral part of the study was the monitoring of adverse events during the treatment .
