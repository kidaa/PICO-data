Effect of <font color="blue">indomethacin_3</font> <font color="blue">phonophoresis_3</font> on the relief of temporomandibular joint pain . 
<br>
<br> The pain - relieving effect of <font color="blue">indomethacin_3</font> <font color="blue">phonophoresis_3</font> on temporomandibular ( TMJ ) joint pain was evaluated in a double - blind , <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">controlled_1</font> clinical trial . Twenty subjects , who have TMJ pain , were included for this study and randomly assigned to either the experimental group ( n = 10 ) or the <font color="blue">control_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> ( n = 10 ) . Each treatment consisted of the application of <font color="blue">ultrasound_3</font> <font color="blue">massage_3</font> ( 1.0 MHz , 0.8 to 1.5 W / cm2 continuous output ) for 15 minutes to the painful temporomandibular joint . As a conducting medium , <font color="blue">1%_2</font> <font color="blue">indomethacin_4</font> <font color="blue">cream_3</font> was used for the experimental group and <font color="blue">placebo_4</font> <font color="blue">cream_2</font> for the control group respectively . Pre- and post - treatment pain levels and pain sensitivity were assessed with visual analogue scales ( VAS ) and pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) . Mean data indicated that post - treatment VAS was significantly decreased and post - treatment PPT was significantly increased in the experimental group , not in the control group . The results of this study suggest that <font color="blue">indomethacin_2</font> <font color="blue">phonophoresis_2</font> provides significant pain relieving effect over the TMJ pain .
