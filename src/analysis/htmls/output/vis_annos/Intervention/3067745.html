<br>
<br> Fifty - one patients with raised intraocular pressure ( IOP ) were treated for up to four years with one of three ophthalmic solutions : <font color="blue">0.5%_2</font> <font color="blue">levobunolol_5</font> <font color="blue">,_5</font> <font color="blue">1%_2</font> <font color="blue">levobunolol_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">0.5%_2</font> <font color="blue">timolol_5</font> <font color="blue">._5</font> The study was conducted as a double - masked , randomised trial in which medications were administered twice daily to both eyes . <font color="blue">Levobunolol_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">timolol_2</font> were equally effective in reducing overall mean IOP ; reductions were greater than 8.8 mmHg in all three treatment groups . The study showed <font color="blue">levobunolol_3</font> to be as safe and effective as <font color="blue">timolol_2</font> in the long - term control of raised IOP .
