Safety and preliminary immunogenicity of <font color="blue">Cuban_2</font> <font color="blue">pneumococcal_2</font> <font color="blue">conjugate_2</font> <font color="blue">vaccine_2</font> candidate in healthy children : a randomized phase I clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> A new <font color="blue">heptavalent_3</font> <font color="blue">conjugate_3</font> <font color="blue">vaccine_3</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">PCV7-TT_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> is under development in Cuba . <font color="blue">PCV7-TT_1</font> contains 2 μg of serotypes 1 , 5 , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F and 4 μg of 6B , each one conjugated to <font color="blue">tetanus_1</font> <font color="blue">toxoid_1</font> ( TT ) . This vaccine was designed with the serotypes that cause most invasive pneumococcal diseases ( IPD ) worldwide . In the present study , we investigated the safety and explored the immunogenicity of <font color="blue">PCV7-TT_1</font> during a controlled , randomized and double blind clinical trial phase I in 4 - 5-year - old children . <font color="blue">PCV7-TT_2</font> was well tolerated and as safe as <font color="blue">Synflorix_2</font> <font color="blue">used_1</font> <font color="blue">as_1</font> <font color="blue">control_1</font> <font color="blue">vaccine_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Following a single - dose vaccination , all individual serotypes included in <font color="blue">PCV7-TT_1</font> induced statistically significant increase of IgG GMC and OPA GMT . These are the first clinical results of <font color="blue">PCV7-TT_2</font> in children and they pave the way toward next clinical trials in children and infants . This clinical trial was published in the Cuban Public Register of Clinical Trials with code RPCEC00000173 .
