<font color="blue">Cryoprobe_1</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_1</font> increases the diagnostic yield in endobronchial tumor lesions . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE <font color="blue">Forceps_1</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_1</font> is the standard method to obtain specimens in endoscopically visible lesions . It is common to <font color="blue">combine_1</font> <font color="blue">forceps_1</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">cytology_1</font> <font color="blue">methods_1</font> to increase the diagnostic yield . Although the <font color="blue">flexible_1</font> <font color="blue">cryoprobe_1</font> has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis , the obtained biopsies , called " <font color="blue">cryobiopsies_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> " have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients . The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of <font color="blue">cryobiopsy_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">forceps_1</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS During a 6-year period , 296 patients with visible endoluminal tumor lesions were included in the study at the bronchoscopy unit of a university hospital . In the first consecutively conducted 55 cases , both techniques , <font color="blue">forceps_3</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_3</font> <font color="blue">and_3</font> <font color="blue">cryobiopsy_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> were applied simultaneously . Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens . We evaluated the safety and diagnostic yield to describe the feasibility of <font color="blue">cryobiopsy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS Comparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher diagnostic yield for <font color="blue">cryobiopsy_1</font> compared with <font color="blue">forceps_1</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_1</font> ( 89.1% vs 65.5% , P < .05 ) . In this cohort , quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger biopsies regarding size and artifact - free tissue sections for <font color="blue">cryobiopsy_1</font> compared with <font color="blue">forceps_1</font> <font color="blue">biopsy_1</font> ( P < .0001 ) . The overall diagnostic yield of <font color="blue">cryobiopsy_1</font> was 89.5% . Mild bleeding occurred in 11 cases ( 3.7% ) , moderate bleeding occurred in 3 cases ( 1.0% ) , and severe bleeding occurred in 1 case ( 0.3% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION <font color="blue">Cryobiopsy_1</font> is safe and increases the diagnostic yield in endobronchial tumor lesions . The method also is feasible under routine conditions .
