Sleep - anticipating effects of <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> in the human brain . 
<br>
<br> <font color="blue">Melatonin_5</font> <font color="blue">,_5</font> the hormone produced nocturnally by the pineal gland , is an endogenous regulator of the sleep - wake cycle . The effects of <font color="blue">melatonin_1</font> on brain activities and their relation to induction of sleepiness were studied in a randomized , double - blind , <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> controlled functional <font color="blue">magnetic_2</font> <font color="blue">resonance_2</font> <font color="blue">imaging_2</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">fMRI_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> study . <font color="blue">Melatonin_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> but not <font color="blue">placebo_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> reduced task - related activity in the rostro - medial aspect of the occipital cortex during a visual - search task and in the auditory cortex during a music task . These effects correlated with subjective measurements of fatigue . In addition , <font color="blue">melatonin_2</font> enhanced the activation in the left parahippocampus in an autobiographic memory task . Results demonstrate that <font color="blue">melatonin_2</font> modulates brain activity in a manner resembling actual sleep although subjects are fully awake . Furthermore , the fatigue inducing effect of <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> on brain activity is essentially different from that of sleep deprivation thus revealing differences between fatigues related to the circadian sleep regulation as opposed to increased homeostatic sleep need . Our findings highlight the role of <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> in priming sleep - associated brain activation patterns in anticipation of sleep .
