<br> Children acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things , but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired . In this article , it is proposed that children acquire generic knowledge by <font color="blue">sharing_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">pretend_1</font> <font color="blue">play_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> In Experiment 1 , twenty - two 3- to 4-year - olds <font color="blue">watched_3</font> <font color="blue">pretense_5</font> <font color="blue">in_4</font> <font color="blue">which_4</font> <font color="blue">a_4</font> <font color="blue">puppet_4</font> <font color="blue">represented_4</font> <font color="blue">a_4</font> <font color="blue">"_4</font> <font color="blue">nerp_4</font> <font color="blue">"_4</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">an_1</font> unfamiliar kind of animal ) . For instance , in one scenario , the nerp ate and disliked a carrot . When subsequently asked generic questions about real nerps , children 's responses suggested that they had learned general facts ( e.g. , nerps dislike carrots ) . In Experiment 2 , thirty - two 4- to 5-year - olds learned from <font color="blue">scenarios_2</font> <font color="blue">lacking_2</font> <font color="blue">pretend_3</font> <font color="blue">speech_2</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">sound_2</font> <font color="blue">effects_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> The findings reveal a long overlooked means by which children can acquire generic knowledge .
