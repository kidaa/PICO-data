Review of the Multicenter Trial Committee report : a prospective , randomized study on the prophylaxis of postoperative <font color="blue">deep_1</font> <font color="blue">venous_2</font> <font color="blue">thrombosis_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> The <font color="blue">etiology_1</font> of postoperative deep venous <font color="blue">thrombosis_1</font> ( DVT ) is thought to be due to a combination of factors including stasis , a <font color="blue">hypercoagulable_1</font> state and venous <font color="blue">endothelial_1</font> damage . Methods of prophylaxis are directed toward correcting one or more of these pathologic events . Methods counteracting more than one of these factors can be expected to be even more effective . The combination of <font color="blue">dihydroergotamine_2</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">DHE_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">heparin_1</font> was anticipated to minimize stasis and the <font color="blue">hypercoagulable_1</font> state respectively . Based upon current experimental evidence and current theory , an additional benefit might include minimizing venous <font color="blue">endothelial_1</font> <font color="blue">injury_1</font> by controlling <font color="blue">venomotor_1</font> <font color="blue">tone_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> A prospective , randomized , double - blind , multicenter trial was designed and performed in the United States evaluating the <font color="blue">prophylactic_1</font> efficacy of <font color="blue">DHE_3</font> <font color="blue">0.5_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">plus_2</font> <font color="blue">heparin_4</font> <font color="blue">5000_2</font> <font color="blue">U_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">DHE_2</font> <font color="blue">0.5_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">plus_2</font> <font color="blue">heparin_3</font> <font color="blue">2500_2</font> <font color="blue">U_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">heparin_3</font> <font color="blue">5000_2</font> <font color="blue">U_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">DHE_3</font> <font color="blue">0.5_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">versus_2</font> <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> General surgical patients including those undergoing noncardiac <font color="blue">thoracic_1</font> and <font color="blue">pelvic_1</font> operations who were identified at moderate to high risk for postop DVT were included . Study medications were injected subcutaneously two hours preoperatively and every 12 hours postoperatively for 5 - 7 days or until the 125I - <font color="blue">fibrinogen_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> uptake test ( RFUT ) became positive . Eight hundred and eighty eight patients were entered into this trial and 744 ( 85% ) completed the study . Results showed a statistically significant benefit from <font color="blue">DHE_1</font> <font color="blue">/_1</font> <font color="blue">Hep_1</font> 5000 compared to <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> ( p less than 0.01 ) and compared to other active agents ( p less than 0.05 ) . None of the other active agents showed a statistically significant <font color="blue">prophylactic_1</font> benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
