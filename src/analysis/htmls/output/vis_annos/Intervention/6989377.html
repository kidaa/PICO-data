<br> The fatty acid composition of the plasma lipid esters has been studied during <font color="blue">lipid_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">lowering_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> of 95 patients with atherosclerotic disease . During the first two months of the trial only a <font color="blue">diet_1</font> was prescribed . During the ensuing two months either <font color="blue">clofibrate_4</font> <font color="blue">or_3</font> <font color="blue">niceritrol_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">nicotinic_2</font> <font color="blue">acid_2</font> <font color="blue">ester_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">was_1</font> <font color="blue">added_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">a_1</font> <font color="blue">randomized_1</font> <font color="blue">order_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> During the last two months the second drug was added . The <font color="blue">combined_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">diet_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">clofibrate_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">niceritrol_2</font> caused highly significant serum lipid reductions . The fatty acid composition in the plasma lipid esters was determined in samples from each trial period to measure the degree of dietary adherence . During dietary treatment the relative content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids secreased and the polyunsaturated fatty acids increased with an increasing ratio between pulyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids ( P / S ratio ) in the cholesterol esters and triglycerides . Only minor changes were seen in the phospholipids . The changes caused by the <font color="blue">diet_1</font> were partly reversed by <font color="blue">clofibrate_1</font> while <font color="blue">niceritrol_1</font> did not cause any major changes of the fatty acid composition . <font color="blue">Clofibrate_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> coincided with increasing amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids , especially oleate ( 18 : 1 ) , in the cholesterol esters , triglycerides and phospholipids while there were significant reductions of the content of linoleic ( 18 : 2 ) acid in both the cholesterol esters and triglycerides . The 18 : 2/18 : 1 ratio decreased significantly in all the lipid esters analyzed . However , the P / S ratio was not significantly affected , partly because the relative content of saturated fatty acids also tended to decrease during clofibrate treatment . It is concluded that addition of clofibrate treatment to patients who are on a diet enriched with polyunsaturated fats is associated with a change from polyunsaturated to monounsaturated fatty acids in the plasma lipid esters but does not significantly effect the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids . The fatty acid changes caused by <font color="blue">clofibrate_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> and counteracted by an increased amount of polyunsaturated fat in the <font color="blue">diet_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
