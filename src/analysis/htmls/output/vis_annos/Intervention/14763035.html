<br> We investigated whether a <font color="blue">selective_2</font> <font color="blue">angiotensin_2</font> <font color="blue">II_2</font> <font color="blue">receptor_2</font> <font color="blue">blocker_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">ARB_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> would have a regressive effect on left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . In a double - blind study , 24 CAPD patients with LVH [ left ventricular mass index ( LVMi ) > 110 g / m2 for women and LVMi > 137 g / m2 for men ] were randomized to <font color="blue">12_1</font> <font color="blue">months_1</font> <font color="blue">'_1</font> <font color="blue">administration_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">either_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">ARB_3</font> <font color="blue">valsartan_4</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">n_1</font> <font color="blue">=_1</font> <font color="blue">14_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> ( n = 10 ) . The target blood pressure ( BP ) was 140/90 mmHg or lower in both groups . The following parameters were measured before and at the end of the study : aortic and large - artery compliance and arterial wave reflections [ pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) and augmentation index ( AI ) application tonometry ] and cardiac echocardiography . Periodically recorded were body weight , BP ( mercury sphygmomanometer ) , serum creatinine , electrolytes , complete blood cell counts , urine volume , drainage volume , and weekly creatinine clearance . Two - way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis . Systolic and diastolic BP were both reduced in patients treated with <font color="blue">ARB_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The LVMi was significantly reduced in patients treated with <font color="blue">ARB_1</font> ( to 121 + /- 4 from 145 + /- 5 ) but not in those receiving <font color="blue">placebo_1</font> ( to 137 + /- 3 from 152 + /- 3 , p < 0.05 ) . The decrease in LVMi was associated with a reduction in PWV and AI . In CAPD patients with LVH , <font color="blue">ARB_1</font> reduced LVMi in association with alterations in arterial hemodynamics .
