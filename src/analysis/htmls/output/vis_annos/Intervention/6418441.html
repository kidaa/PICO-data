Both the patients ' ( p less than 0.05 ) and the clinicians ' ( p less than 0.01 ) treatment opinions , and their treatment preferences ( p less than 0.05 ) , favoured <font color="blue">sodium_1</font> <font color="blue">cromoglycate_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Moreover , usage of bronchodilators ( <font color="blue">theophylline_1</font> and aerosol beta - stimulants combined ) declined significantly ( p less than 0.001 ) during sodium cromoglycate treatment compared to placebo . No side - effects were reported . The results of this study show that <font color="blue">sodium_1</font> <font color="blue">cromoglycate_1</font> delivered by pressurized aerosol was significantly superior to placebo , not only in improving asthmatic symptoms , but also in reducing the amount of <font color="blue">concomitant_1</font> <font color="blue">bronchodilator_1</font> <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> required .
