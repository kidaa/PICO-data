The role of <font color="blue">somatostatin_4</font> <font color="blue">(_4</font> <font color="blue">octreotide_4</font> <font color="blue">)_4</font> in the regulation of melatonin secretion in healthy volunteers and in patients with primary hypothyroidism . 
<br>
<br> <font color="blue">Somatostatin_3</font> has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species , which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion . Whether <font color="blue">somatostatin_3</font> has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown . We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in 8 healthy volunteers , and 6 women with untreated primary hypothyroidism , a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin . The participants were given <font color="blue">subcutaneous_1</font> <font color="blue">injections_1</font> at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either <font color="blue">saline_5</font> <font color="blue">or_3</font> <font color="blue">octreotide_4</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">Sandostatin_4</font> <font color="blue">;_4</font> <font color="blue">each_1</font> <font color="blue">injection_1</font> <font color="blue">50_1</font> <font color="blue">microg_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> . During the nights when the healthy volunteers were given <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during <font color="blue">administration_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">saline_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions . By contrast , the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy <font color="blue">controls_1</font> were given <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> ( GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU / l x h during <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> and 126.6+/-21.9 mU / l x h during <font color="blue">saline_2</font> <font color="blue">;_2</font> p<0.01 ) . The patients with hypothyroidism also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">saline_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged , as did GH secretion . The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was , however , significantly reduced by <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> ( TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU / l x h during <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> and 851+/-185 mU / l x h during <font color="blue">saline_2</font> <font color="blue">;_2</font> p<0.05 ) , thus suggesting that 100 microg of <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by <font color="blue">somatostatin_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Since exogenous <font color="blue">somatostatin_3</font> <font color="blue">--_3</font> in the form of <font color="blue">octreotide_2</font> <font color="blue">--_2</font> fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in normal subjects and in patients with primary hypothyroidism , it is reasonable to assume that endogenous <font color="blue">somatostatin_3</font> may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man .
