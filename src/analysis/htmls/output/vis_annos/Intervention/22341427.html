<br> OBJECTIVE The study objective was to identify factors associated with death and <font color="blue">cardiac_3</font> <font color="blue">transplantation_3</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">infants_1</font> <font color="blue">undergoing_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">Norwood_4</font> <font color="blue">procedure_4</font> and to determine differences in associations that might favor the modified <font color="blue">Blalock_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">Taussig_1</font> <font color="blue">shunt_1</font> or a right ventricle - to - pulmonary <font color="blue">artery_1</font> <font color="blue">shunt_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS We used competing risks methodology to analyze death without transplantation , cardiac transplantation , and survival without transplantation . Parametric time - to - event modeling and bootstrapping were used to identify independent predictors . 
<br> RESULTS Data from 549 subjects ( follow - up , 2.7 Â± 0.9 years ) were analyzed . Mortality risk was characterized by early and constant phases ; transplant was characterized by only a constant phase . Early phase factors associated with death included lower socioeconomic status ( P = .01 ) , obstructed pulmonary venous return ( P < .001 ) , smaller ascending aorta ( P = .02 ) , and anatomic subtype . Constant phase factors associated with death included genetic syndrome ( P < .001 ) and lower gestational age ( P < .001 ) . The right ventricle - to - pulmonary <font color="blue">artery_1</font> <font color="blue">shunt_1</font> demonstrated better survival in the 51% of subjects who were full term with aortic atresia ( P < .001 ) . The modified <font color="blue">Blalock_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">Taussig_1</font> <font color="blue">shunt_1</font> was better among the 4% of subjects who were preterm with a patent aortic valve ( P = .003 ) . Lower pre - Norwood right ventricular fractional area change , pre - Norwood surgery , and anatomy other than hypoplastic left heart syndrome were independently associated with transplantation ( all P < .03 ) , but shunt type was not ( P = .43 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Independent risk factors for intermediate - term mortality include lower socioeconomic status , anatomy , genetic syndrome , and lower gestational age . Term infants with aortic atresia benefited from a right ventricle - to - pulmonary <font color="blue">artery_1</font> <font color="blue">shunt_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and preterm infants with a patent aortic valve benefited from a modified <font color="blue">Blalock_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">Taussig_1</font> <font color="blue">shunt_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Right ventricular function and anatomy , but not shunt type , were associated with <font color="blue">transplantation_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
