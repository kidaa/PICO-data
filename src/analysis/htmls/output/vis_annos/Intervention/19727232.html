<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To explore the short - term treatment effect of the <font color="blue">auditory_2</font> <font color="blue">integrative_2</font> <font color="blue">training_2</font> on autistic children and provide them with <font color="blue">clinical_1</font> <font color="blue">support_1</font> <font color="blue">for_1</font> <font color="blue">rehabilitative_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used . They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one , and respectively <font color="blue">received_1</font> <font color="blue">auditory_3</font> <font color="blue">integrative_3</font> <font color="blue">training_3</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">no_3</font> <font color="blue">training_3</font> <font color="blue">based_1</font> <font color="blue">on_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">multiple_2</font> <font color="blue">therapies_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) and intelligence quotient ( IQ ) before and after six months of treatment . The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ . The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC - R. 
<br> RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the <font color="blue">auditory_1</font> <font color="blue">integrative_1</font> <font color="blue">training_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects , such as the disorders of their language , social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors . The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped . The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics ( P < 0.01 ) . The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age , and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation ) with base IQ . 
<br> CONCLUSION The treatment of <font color="blue">auditory_1</font> <font color="blue">integrative_1</font> <font color="blue">training_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">AIT_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> could greatly improve on language disorders , the difficulties of social interactions , typical behavior symptoms and developmental levels , therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short - term treatment effect .
