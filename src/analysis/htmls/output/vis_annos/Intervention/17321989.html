The prophylactic effect of <font color="blue">itraconazole_4</font> <font color="blue">capsules_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">fluconazole_4</font> <font color="blue">capsules_2</font> for systemic fungal infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes : a Japanese multicenter randomized , controlled study . 
<br>
<br> We performed a randomized , controlled study comparing the prophylactic effects of capsule forms of <font color="blue">fluconazole_3</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">n_1</font> <font color="blue">=_1</font> <font color="blue">110_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> and <font color="blue">itraconazole_3</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">n_1</font> <font color="blue">=_1</font> <font color="blue">108_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) during and after <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> There were 4 cases with possible systemic fungal infection in the <font color="blue">itraconazole_2</font> group , and there were 8 possible and 3 probable cases in the <font color="blue">fluconazole_2</font> group . Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups . In patients with MDS or in the remission - induction phase of <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> the numbers of cases with probable or possible infections were lower in the <font color="blue">itraconazole_1</font> group than in the <font color="blue">fluconazole_1</font> group , whereas no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> In patients with neutrophil counts of > 0.1 x 10(9)/L lasting for more than 4 weeks , the frequency of infection in the <font color="blue">fluconazole_1</font> group ( 5 of 9 patients ) was significantly higher than in the <font color="blue">itraconazole_1</font> group ( 0 of 7 patients ; P = .03 ) . Our results suggest that both drugs were well tolerated in patients with AML or MDS who received <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> and that the efficacy of <font color="blue">itraconazole_1</font> for prophylaxis against systemic fungal disease is not inferior to that of <font color="blue">fluconazole_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
