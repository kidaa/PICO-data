<br>
<br> <font color="blue">Fluoroscopy_1</font> is a reliable , easy , and readily available technique to follow - up prosthesis functioning after heart valve surgery . The different orientation given to the prosthesis may represent a limitation of the technique accounting for unsatisfactory results in 10% to 40% of the cases . The aim of the study was to evaluate whether and to what extent different <font color="blue">intraoperative_1</font> <font color="blue">valve_1</font> <font color="blue">orientation_1</font> influence feasibility and accuracy of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluation of bileaflet prostheses . We prospectively evaluated 90 patients who had <font color="blue">aortic_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">mitral_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and/or_1</font> <font color="blue">tricuspid_1</font> <font color="blue">valve_1</font> <font color="blue">replacement_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">Sorin_1</font> <font color="blue">Bicarbon_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">CarboMedics_1</font> <font color="blue">bileaflet_1</font> <font color="blue">prostheses_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Fifty percent of the patients in each group were randomly assigned to <font color="blue">receive_1</font> <font color="blue">prostheses_2</font> <font color="blue">oriented_2</font> <font color="blue">in_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">perpendicular_2</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">parallel_2</font> <font color="blue">position_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">respect_2</font> <font color="blue">to_2</font> <font color="blue">the_2</font> <font color="blue">ventricular_2</font> <font color="blue">septum_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Fluoroscopic evaluation was considered appropriate when the prosthesis ' " tilting disk " projection was obtained . The valve 's hemodynamic performance was investigated through Doppler study . A proper fluoroscopic evaluation was rapidly ( 15 + /- 5 seconds ) achieved in all patients with the former orientation , whereas it was impossible to obtain it in 8 of 20 ( 40% ) , 19 of 20 ( 95% ) , and 4 of 5 ( 80% ) of patients with the latter orientation . In the remaining patients extremely angulated , uneasy projection was often required to get a correct fluoroscopic image . The Doppler study showed a similarly favorable hemodynamic performance regardless of <font color="blue">valve_1</font> <font color="blue">orientation_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Prosthesis orientation crucially affects the rate of success of the fluoroscopic evaluation . The orientation perpendicular to the ventricular septum greatly facilitates the postoperative feasibility and accuracy of fluoroscopy , and it is not detrimental to the valve 's hemodynamic performance . This <font color="blue">valve_1</font> <font color="blue">orientation_1</font> may provide a better fluoroscopic window whenever a valve dysfunction is suspected .
