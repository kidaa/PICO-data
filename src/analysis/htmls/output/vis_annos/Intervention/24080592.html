Effect of <font color="blue">simvastatin_3</font> on hemostasis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUNDS / AIMS Elevated triglyceride levels seem to predispose to the earlier development and accelerated progression of coronary artery disease . In our study , we assessed for the first time whether <font color="blue">simvastatin_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> affects coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia . 
<br> METHODS The study included 39 patients with elevated triglyceride levels and peripheral artery sclerosis , treated for 90 days with either <font color="blue">simvastatin_4</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">40_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">daily_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">placebo_5</font> <font color="blue">._5</font> Plasma lipids , glucose homeostasis markers and hemostasic variables were assessed at baseline and after treatment . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="blue">Simvastatin_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> but not <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> administered to these patients reduced plasma levels / activity of fibrinogen ( from 3.5 ± 0.4 to 2.8 ± 0.3 g / l , p < 0.01 ) , factor VII ( from 144.2 ± 16.9 to 112.5 ± 14.0% , p < 0.01 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( from 76.9 ± 13.5 to 50.2 ± 9.2 ng / ml , p < 0.001 ) , without a significant reduction in von Willebrand factor levels , and tended to prolong the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times . 
<br> CONCLUSION Our results suggest that <font color="blue">statin_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_2</font> produces a multidirectional effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and that this treatment may bring some benefits to patients with elevated triglyceride levels .
