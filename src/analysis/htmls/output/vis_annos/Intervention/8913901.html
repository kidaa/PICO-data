Methodology of serial ECG classification using an adaptation of the NOVACODE for Q wave myocardial infarction in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ( BARI ) . 
<br>
<br> Serial electrocardiographic ( ECG ) changes are a critical component of the diagnostic algorithm for classification of myocardial ischemic events in large - scale clinical trials . This study describes a computerized <font color="blue">serial_1</font> <font color="blue">ECG_2</font> <font color="blue">classification_2</font> <font color="blue">program_1</font> developed at the St. Louis University Core ECG Laboratory for use in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ( BARI ) trial , in which patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were randomized to receive either <font color="blue">coronary_4</font> <font color="blue">artery_4</font> <font color="blue">bypass_4</font> <font color="blue">grafting_4</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">percutaneous_4</font> <font color="blue">transluminal_4</font> <font color="blue">coronary_4</font> <font color="blue">angioplasty_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> The St. Louis University program detects and codes serial changes in Q , ST , and T wave items according to Minnesota code ( MC ) criteria using a modified NOVACODE hierarchical classification system . Measurements using a seven - power calibrated coding loupe are used to generate the MC from a customized software program . Significant minor or major changes are detected by the serial comparison program and referred to a physician coder for verification . Serial comparison coding rules are used to adjust for weaknesses in the standard MC classification system resulting from instability at decision boundaries . Of 4,244 BARI randomized and registry study participants with follow - up ECGs received at the Core ECG Laboratory as of March 1995 , a grade 2 MC Q wave progression was noted in 568 participants ( 13.4% ) using MC criteria alone , as compared with 367 ( 8.6% ) after the St. Louis University coding rules were applied . The incidence of grade 1 MC Q wave progressions was 16.4% ( 697/4,244 ) versus 6.1% ( 259/4,244 ) when the St. Louis University program was applied . Intraobserver variability for grade 2 Q wave progression codes determined from a sample of 812 serial .
