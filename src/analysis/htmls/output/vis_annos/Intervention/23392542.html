Plasma AGE - peptides and C - peptide in early - stage diabetic nephropathy patients on thiamine and pyridoxine therapy . 
<br>
<br> AIM The aim of the study was to evaluate circulatory AGE - peptide levels in diabetic nephropathy and to observe the effects of <font color="blue">thiamine_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">vitamin_3</font> <font color="blue">B1_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">pyridoxine_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">vitamin_3</font> <font color="blue">B6_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> METHODS Type 2 diabetic patients ( N.=57 ) were divided into two groups as " with nephropathy " ( N.=27 ) and " without nephropathy " ( N.=30 ) . Diabetic nephropathy patients were treated with either <font color="blue">B6_3</font> ( N.=12 ) ( 250 mg / day ) or <font color="blue">B1+B6_3</font> ( N.=15 ) ( 250 mg / day , each ) for five months . At the beginning and the end of the experimentation period , glucose , HbA1c , triglyceride , cholesterol , insulin , C - peptide , thiamine pyrophosphate , pyridoxal phosphate and AGE- peptides were measured . 
<br> RESULTS AGE - peptides were higher in the diabetic group with nephropathy than without nephropathy ( P=0.005 ) . Within five months AGE - peptides increased in the diabetic group without nephropathy ( P=0.042 ) but not in the group with nephropathy treated either with <font color="blue">B1+B6_2</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">B6_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> In <font color="blue">B6_2</font> <font color="blue">treated_1</font> group a substantial decrease was observed in HbA1c ( P=0.033 ) . <font color="blue">B1+B6_2</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">B6_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> both caused an increase in C - peptide ( P=0.006 , P=0.004 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Among the parameters measured , plasma AGE - peptides was the only parameter found to be higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients " with nephropathy " than " without nephropathy " . However , patients with nephropathy treated with <font color="blue">B1+B6_2</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">B6_2</font> did not display any further increase in AGE - peptides within five months . Both of the treatments caused an increase in C - peptide .
