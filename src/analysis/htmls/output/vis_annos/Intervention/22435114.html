<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Children with high - functioning autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety . Anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school , home and community environments . <font color="blue">Cognitive_4</font> <font color="blue">behavioral_4</font> <font color="blue">therapies_4</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">CBT_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms . <font color="blue">Modified_1</font> <font color="blue">CBT_2</font> <font color="blue">interventions_1</font> for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded promising results . 
<br> METHODS Fifty children with high - functioning ASD and anxiety were <font color="blue">randomizedto_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">CBT_2</font> or <font color="blue">treatment_4</font> <font color="blue">-_4</font> <font color="blue">as_4</font> <font color="blue">-_4</font> <font color="blue">usual_4</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">TAU_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> for 12 weeks . Independent clinical evaluators , blind to condition , completed structured interviews ( Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule â€“ Parent Version;ADIS - P ) pre- and post - intervention condition . 
<br> RESULTS Forty - seven children completed either the <font color="blue">CBT_3</font> or <font color="blue">TAU_3</font> condition . Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the <font color="blue">CBT_3</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Significant differences by group were noted in Clinician Severity Ratings , diagnostic status , and clinician ratings of global improvement . In the intent - to - treat sample , 10 of 20 children ( 50% ) in the <font color="blue">CBT_2</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> had a clinically meaningful positive treatment response , compared to 2 of 23 children ( 8.7% ) in the <font color="blue">TAU_2</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Initial results from this randomized , designed treatment study suggest that agroup <font color="blue">CBT_3</font> <font color="blue">intervention_1</font> specifically developed for children with ASD may be effective in decreasing anxiety . Limitations of this study include small sample size , lack of an attention <font color="blue">control_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and use of outcome measures normed with typically developing children
