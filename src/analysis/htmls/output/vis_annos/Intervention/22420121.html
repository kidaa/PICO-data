<font color="blue">Training_1</font> <font color="blue">referential_2</font> <font color="blue">communicative_2</font> <font color="blue">skills_2</font> to individuals with autism spectrum disorder : a pilot study . 
<br>
<br> The present study reports the effects of <font color="blue">referential_4</font> <font color="blue">communication_4</font> <font color="blue">training_4</font> in individuals formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Participants were 20 children with ASD ( M age = 14.3 yr . , SD = 4.2 ; 6 girls , 14 boys ) in the role of <font color="blue">speakers_1</font> and 20 control children , who acted as <font color="blue">listeners_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> They were all enrolled in mainstream compulsory education . Inclusion / exclusion criteria were defined according to the clinical diagnosis of ASD , the presence or absence of additional or associated disability , previous training in referential communication , and any drug treatment . Speakers were randomly assigned to one of two groups ( trained vs untrained ) . Linguistic age , cognitive level and autistic symptoms were analyzed , respectively , with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( PPVT ) , the Wechsler Intelligence Scale ( WISC - R or WAIS - III ) , and the Autistic Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) . Communicative abilities were analyzed through two indexes related to message complexity and self - regulation . The trained group was <font color="blue">trained_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">referential_2</font> <font color="blue">communication_2</font> <font color="blue">tasks_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">task_1</font> <font color="blue">analysis_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">role_1</font> <font color="blue">taking_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">task_1</font> <font color="blue">evaluation_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> while the untrained group took part in a <font color="blue">communicative_1</font> <font color="blue">game_1</font> <font color="blue">but_1</font> <font color="blue">without_1</font> <font color="blue">any_1</font> <font color="blue">specific_1</font> <font color="blue">communicative_1</font> <font color="blue">training_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The results showed that the complexity of emitted messages had improved statistically significantly in the trained group as an effect of training . <font color="blue">Ecological_2</font> <font color="blue">referential_3</font> <font color="blue">communication_3</font> is shown to be an appropriate paradigm for studying the communicative process and its products and could be used to develop and implement a training program focused on those skills in which individuals with ASD are most deficient .
