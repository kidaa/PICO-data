Effects of <font color="blue">Saccharomyces_4</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_4</font> in children with acute diarrhoea . 
<br>
<br> AIM Certain probiotic agents , e.g. Lactobacillus GG , have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea , but few studies have examined the effect of <font color="blue">Saccharomyces_2</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> We evaluated the effect of <font color="blue">S._3</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_3</font> in children with acute diarrhoea . 
<br> METHODS Two hundred children were randomized to receive <font color="blue">S._4</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_4</font> in a granulated form in a daily dose of 250 mg ( <font color="blue">S._2</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_2</font> group ) or <font color="blue">placebo_4</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> group ) for 5 d. Clinical and demographic characteristics on admission were similar between the study groups . 
<br> RESULTS The medians of the average stool frequency after the second day of the treatment were significantly lower in the <font color="blue">S._1</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_1</font> group than in the <font color="blue">placebo_1</font> group ( p = 0.003 ) . The duration of diarrhoea significantly reduced in the <font color="blue">S._2</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_2</font> group compared with the <font color="blue">placebo_1</font> group ( 4.7 vs 5.5 d , p = 0.03 ) . The effect of <font color="blue">S._1</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_1</font> on watery diarrhoea became apparent after the second day of the treatment . The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the <font color="blue">S._2</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_2</font> group than in the <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> group ( 2.9 vs 3.9 d , p < 0.001 ) . Four children from the <font color="blue">placebo_1</font> group versus only one child from the <font color="blue">S._2</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_2</font> group had persisting diarrhoea . 
<br> CONCLUSION The <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> controlled study suggested that <font color="blue">S._1</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_1</font> significantly reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and the duration of hospital stay . <font color="blue">S._2</font> <font color="blue">boulardii_2</font> seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically .
