Comparison of weakness progression in inclusion body myositis during <font color="blue">treatment_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">methotrexate_3</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font>

<br> We investigated whether <font color="blue">5_2</font> <font color="blue">to_2</font> <font color="blue">20_2</font> <font color="blue">mg_2</font> <font color="blue">per_2</font> <font color="blue">week_2</font> <font color="blue">oral_3</font> <font color="blue">methotrexate_5</font> could slow down disease progression in 44 patients with inclusion body myositis in a randomized double - blind <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> controlled study over 48 weeks . Mean change of quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores was the primary study outcome measure . Quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores declined in both treatment groups , -0.2% for <font color="blue">methotrexate_3</font> and -3.4% for <font color="blue">placebo_3</font> ( 95% confidence interval = -2.5% to + 9.1% for difference ) . There were also no differences in manual muscle testing sum scores , activity scale scores and patients ' own assessments after 48 weeks of treatment . Serum creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in the <font color="blue">methotrexate_3</font> group . We conclude that <font color="blue">oral_1</font> <font color="blue">methotrexate_3</font> did not slow down progression of muscle weakness but decreased serum creatine kinase activity .
