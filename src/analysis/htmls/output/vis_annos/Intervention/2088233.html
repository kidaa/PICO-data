<br>
<br> A randomized , double - blind , <font color="blue">placebo_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">controlled_1</font> study on the immediate clinical and microbiological efficacy of <font color="blue">doxycycline_6</font> ( 100 mg for 14 days ) was carried out to determine the benefit of <font color="blue">adjunctive_1</font> <font color="blue">medication_1</font> in 16 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis . Measurements of gingival fluid flow , probing depths , bleeding on probing and suppuration were determined at 2 periodontal sites with and 2 without radiographic attachment loss , at weeks 0 , 1 , 3 and 8 . Subgingival bacterial samples were taken with curettes from the same sites . Spirochaetes were searched for by dark - field microscopy . Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , pigmented and non - pigmented Bacteroides spp . , Capnocytophaga , Fusobacterium and Actinomyces spp . were cultured on various selective and non - selective media . Bacterial species found at least in 50% of the patients and comprising on average 5% or more of the cultivable flora were included in the analysis . Neither short - term clinical nor microbiological efficacy beyond that of a course of <font color="blue">mechanical_1</font> <font color="blue">debridement_1</font> <font color="blue">alone_1</font> was found by using <font color="blue">systemic_1</font> <font color="blue">medication_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">doxycycline_4</font> in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis .
