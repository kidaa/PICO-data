Spotty calcification as a marker of accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis : insights from serial intravascular ultrasound . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine atheroma progression in patients with spotty calcification . 
<br> BACKGROUND Although extensively calcified atherosclerotic lesions have been proposed to be clinically quiescent , the presence of spotty calcification within plaque has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events . The relationship between spotty calcification and disease progression has not been investigated . 
<br> METHODS A total of <font color="blue">1,347_1</font> <font color="blue">stable_1</font> <font color="blue">patients_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">angiographic_1</font> <font color="blue">coronary_1</font> <font color="blue">artery_1</font> <font color="blue">disease_1</font> <font color="blue">underwent_1</font> <font color="blue">serial_2</font> <font color="blue">evaluation_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">atheroma_2</font> <font color="blue">burden_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">intravascular_4</font> <font color="blue">ultrasound_4</font> <font color="blue">imaging_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> Patients with spotty calcification were identified based on the presence of lesions ( 1 to 4 mm in length ) containing an arc of calcification of < 90°. Clinical characteristics and disease progression were compared between patients with <font color="blue">spotty_1</font> <font color="blue">calcification_1</font> ( n = 922 ) and those with <font color="blue">no_1</font> <font color="blue">calcification_1</font> ( n = 425 ) . 
<br> RESULTS Patients with spotty calcification were older ( age 56 years vs. 54 years ; p = 0.001 ) , more likely to be male ( 68% vs. 54% ; p = 0.01 ) , and have a history of diabetes mellitus ( 30% vs. 24% ; p = 0.01 ) and myocardial infarction ( 28% vs. 20% ; p = 0.004 ) , and have lower on - treatment high - density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 48 ± 16 mg / dl vs. 51 ± 17 mg / dl ; p = 0.001 ) . Patients with spotty calcification demonstrated a greater percent atheroma volume ( PAV ) ( 36.0 ± 7.6% vs. 29.0 ± 8.5% ; p < 0.001 ) and total atheroma volume ( 174.6 ± 71.9 mm(3 ) vs. 133.9 ± 64.9 mm(3 ) ; p < 0.001 ) . On serial evaluation , spotty calcification was associated with greater progression of PAV ( + 0.43 ± 0.07% vs. + 0.02 ± 0.11% ; p = 0.002 ) . Although intensive <font color="blue">low_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">density_1</font> <font color="blue">lipoprotein_1</font> <font color="blue">cholesterol_1</font> and <font color="blue">blood_1</font> <font color="blue">pressure_1</font> <font color="blue">lowering_1</font> <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> slowed disease progression , these efficacies were attenuated in patients with spotty calcification . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The presence of spotty calcification is associated with more extensive and diffuse coronary atherosclerosis and accelerated disease progression despite use of medical therapies .
