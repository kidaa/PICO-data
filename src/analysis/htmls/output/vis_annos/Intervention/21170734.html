Serum biochemical characteristics of Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) , in response to blood sampling after clove powder solution exposure . 
<br>
<br> In order to investigate the effect of anesthesia on serum parameters , Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) were <font color="blue">blood_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">sampled_1</font> <font color="blue">immediately_1</font> <font color="blue">without_2</font> <font color="blue">anesthesia_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">control_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">subjected_2</font> <font color="blue">to_2</font> <font color="blue">following_2</font> <font color="blue">anesthesia_2</font> <font color="blue">procedure_2</font> <font color="blue">:_2</font> <font color="blue">40_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">120_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">240_1</font> <font color="blue">s_1</font> <font color="blue">exposure_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">3,000_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">700_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">500_1</font> <font color="blue">mg_1</font> <font color="blue">l⁻¹_1</font> <font color="blue">clove_1</font> <font color="blue">solution_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> respectively . Blood samples were collected after these periods , when fish were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia . Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control . Serum lactate levels were significantly high in 500 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control group . Lactate levels were not significantly differed between control , 3,000 , and 700 mg l⁻¹ groups . There were no significant differences in serum levels of cholesterol , total protein , lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , Na⁺ , Cl⁻ , K⁺ , and Ca²⁺. Results suggest that rapid anesthesia with higher dose is better than slow anesthesia with lower dose for blood sampling in Beluga .
