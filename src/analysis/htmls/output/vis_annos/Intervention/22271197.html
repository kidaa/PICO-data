Goal attainment scaling as an outcome measure in randomized controlled trials of <font color="blue">psychosocial_3</font> <font color="blue">interventions_3</font> in autism . 
<br>
<br> <font color="blue">Goal_1</font> <font color="blue">attainment_1</font> <font color="blue">scaling_1</font> ( GAS ) holds promise as an idiographic approach for measuring outcomes of <font color="blue">psychosocial_2</font> <font color="blue">interventions_2</font> in community settings . GAS has been criticized for untested assumptions of scaling level ( i.e. , interval or ordinal ) , inter - individual equivalence and comparability , and reliability of coding across different behavioral observation methods . We tested assumptions of equality between GAS descriptions for outcome measurement in a randomized trial ( i.e. , measurability , equidistance , level of difficulty , comparability of behavior samples collected from teachers vs. researchers and live vs. videotape ) . Results suggest GAS descriptions can be evaluated for equivalency , that teacher collected behavior samples are representative , and that varied sources of behavior samples can be reliably coded . GAS is a promising measurement approach . Recommendations are provided to ensure methodological quality .
