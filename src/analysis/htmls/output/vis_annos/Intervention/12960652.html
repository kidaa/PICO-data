Gastric dysrhythmia in infants with gastrointestinal diseases measured by <font color="blue">epigastric_2</font> <font color="blue">impedance_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia , where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described . These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by <font color="blue">electrogastrography_2</font> <font color="blue">using_1</font> <font color="blue">cutaneous_1</font> <font color="blue">electrodes_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> <font color="blue">Epigastric_1</font> <font color="blue">impedance_1</font> is a non - invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity . At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia , measured with <font color="blue">epigastric_2</font> <font color="blue">impedance_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> has been presented , and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of <font color="blue">impedance_1</font> <font color="blue">gastrography_1</font> in control infants , compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases , before and after treatment of their disease . 
<br> METHOD 21 patients ( age 0 - 2 months ) and 40 healthy infants ( age 0 - 2 months ) were investigated . The patients suffered from partial or total intestinal obstruction , necrotizing enterocolitis or pyloric stenosis . All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour . The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible . 
<br> RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90% of the patients . A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients , high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients . Short - term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants ( 32.5% ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Using <font color="blue">epigastric_2</font> <font color="blue">impedance_2</font> we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity , which was not found in the control infants . The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown , but they may be related to electrical control activity .
