Rapid tightening of blood glucose control leads to transient deterioration of retinopathy in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus : the Oslo study . 
<br>
<br> In a study of retinopathy during one year of tight blood <font color="blue">glucose_1</font> control 45 type I ( insulin dependent ) diabetics without proliferative retinopathy were randomised to receive either <font color="blue">continuous_3</font> <font color="blue">subcutaneous_3</font> <font color="blue">insulin_4</font> <font color="blue">infusion_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">multiple_3</font> <font color="blue">insulin_4</font> <font color="blue">injections_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">conventional_3</font> <font color="blue">insulin_4</font> <font color="blue">treatment_3</font> ( controls ) . Near normoglycaemia was achieved with <font color="blue">continuous_1</font> <font color="blue">infusion_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">multiple_1</font> <font color="blue">injections_1</font> but not with conventional treatment . Blind evaluation of fluorescein angiograms performed three monthly showed progression of retinopathy in the <font color="blue">control_1</font> group , transient deterioration in the <font color="blue">continuous_1</font> <font color="blue">infusion_1</font> group , and no change in the <font color="blue">multiple_1</font> <font color="blue">injection_1</font> group . Half the patients receiving continuous infusion and multiple injections developed retinal cotton wool spots after three to six months . These changes regressed in all but four patients after 12 months . Control patients did not develop cotton wool spots . Patients who developed cotton wool spots are characterised by a larger decrement in glycosylated haemoglobin and blood glucose values , more frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia , a longer duration of diabetes , and more severe retinopathy at onset . A large and rapid fall in blood glucose concentration may promote transient deterioration of diabetic retinopathy .
