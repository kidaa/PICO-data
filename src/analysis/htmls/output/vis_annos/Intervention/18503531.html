<br> BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new <font color="blue">multi_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">component_2</font> <font color="blue">social_2</font> <font color="blue">skills_2</font> <font color="blue">intervention_2</font> for children with Asperger syndrome ( AS ) : <font color="blue">The_4</font> <font color="blue">Junior_4</font> <font color="blue">Detective_4</font> <font color="blue">Training_4</font> <font color="blue">Program_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> This 7-week program included a <font color="blue">computer_1</font> <font color="blue">game_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">small_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">sessions_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">parent_1</font> <font color="blue">training_1</font> <font color="blue">sessions_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">teacher_1</font> <font color="blue">handouts_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> METHOD Forty - nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to <font color="blue">intervention_1</font> ( n = 26 ) or <font color="blue">wait_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">list_1</font> <font color="blue">control_1</font> ( n = 23 ) conditions . 
<br> RESULTS Relative to children in the <font color="blue">wait_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">list_1</font> group , program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention , as indicated by parent - report measures . Teacher - report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post - treatment . <font color="blue">Treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion - management strategies for story characters at post - intervention than at pre - intervention , whereas <font color="blue">control_1</font> <font color="blue">participants_1</font> were not . However , there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body - posture recognition measures . Follow - up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post - intervention .
