Compensation in intergroup relations : an investigation of its structural and strategic foundations . 
<br>
<br> Recent work in intergroup relations stresses the role of two fundamental dimensions , <font color="blue">competence_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">warmth_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> which organize the perception of social groups . A pattern often encountered in people 's ratings is one of <font color="blue">compensation_1</font> in that a group that is evaluated higher than another group on one of the two fundamental dimensions is also judged lower on the <font color="blue">other_1</font> <font color="blue">fundamental_1</font> <font color="blue">dimension_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Based on Social Identity Theory , the present work extends previous research on <font color="blue">compensation_1</font> by examining boundary conditions as well as underlying psychological processes . Two studies involving experimental and correlational evidence , minimal and real groups , and different kinds of conflict , reveal that <font color="blue">compensation_1</font> is more likely when the groups are in asymmetrical relation and share a cooperative view of the intergroup setting . Our data also suggest that , among members of low status groups , <font color="blue">compensation_1</font> is associated with social creativity . In contrast , and in line with the ' noblesse oblige ' effect , members of the high status group would seem to rely on <font color="blue">compensation_1</font> as a means to appear non - discriminatory .
