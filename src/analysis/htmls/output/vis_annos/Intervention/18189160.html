<br>
<br> Addition of <font color="blue">epirubicin_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">adjuvant_1</font> <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer , but the optimal dose remains unclear . Further improvements can be achieved with dose - dense regimens , but densification of <font color="blue">fluorouracil_4</font> <font color="blue">/_4</font> <font color="blue">epirubicin_4</font> <font color="blue">/_4</font> <font color="blue">cyclophosphamide_4</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">FEC_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> has proved difficult , with FEC(60 ) providing little benefit over <font color="blue">standard_1</font> <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">FEC(100_2</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> associated with toxicity . We investigated the feasibility of <font color="blue">two_1</font> <font color="blue">intermediate_1</font> <font color="blue">dose_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">dense_2</font> <font color="blue">FEC_2</font> <font color="blue">regimens_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Patients were randomised to <font color="blue">six_1</font> <font color="blue">cycles_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">FEC(75_2</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">FEC(90_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> , with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle . Patients also received <font color="blue">pegfilgrastim_2</font> <font color="blue">6_1</font> <font color="blue">mg_1</font> as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle . The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or = 85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75 ) and FEC(90 ) arms , respectively . Of 147 <font color="blue">FEC(75_1</font> ) infusions , 4.1% were delayed , while 9.8% of 143 <font color="blue">FEC(90_1</font> ) infusions were delayed . The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal / logistical reasons . One dose reduction occurred during the study ( <font color="blue">FEC(90_1</font> ) ) , related to diarrhoea . Grade 3 - 4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the <font color="blue">FEC(90_1</font> ) arm . There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study . The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events ; no event resulted in discontinuation . Only one patient ( <font color="blue">FEC(90_1</font> ) ) experienced serious adverse events ( vomiting and throat oedema ) . In conclusion , dose - dense <font color="blue">FEC(75_1</font> ) and <font color="blue">FEC(90_1</font> ) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support . These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3 - 4 toxicity .
