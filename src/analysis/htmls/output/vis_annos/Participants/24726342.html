<br> BACKGROUND <font color="blue">In_2</font> <font color="blue">COPD_3</font> <font color="blue">patients_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s ( ΔFEV1 ) and forced vital capacity ( ΔFVC ) . By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone , bronchodilators should decrease dynamic hyperinflation , gas trapping , and possibly dyspnea at rest . Hence , we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes ( ΔsRAW ) should better characterize the acute response to bronchodilators . 
<br> METHODS <font color="blue">On_1</font> <font color="blue">two_1</font> <font color="blue">days_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">60_5</font> <font color="blue">COPD_5</font> <font color="blue">patients_5</font> underwent dyspnea evaluation ( VAS score ) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after placebo or 300μg indacaterol administration . 
<br> RESULTS Spirographic and ΔsRAW - based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients , respectively . ΔsRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume ( ΔITGV ) ( r=0.61 ; p<0.001 ) , residual volume ( ΔRV ) ( r=0.60 ; p<0.001 ) , ΔFVC ( r=0.44 ; p=0.001 ) , and ΔVAS ( r=0.73 ; p<0.001 ) , while ΔFEV1 correlated only with ΔFVC ( r=0.34 ; p=0.008 ) . Significant differences in terms of ΔITGV ( p=0.002 ) , ΔRV ( p=0.023 ) , and ΔVAS ( p<0.001 ) occurred only if patients were stratified according to ΔsRAW . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In assessing the acute functional effect of bronchodilators , ΔsRAW - based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC - based criteria , being more closely related to bronchodilator - induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest .
