<br> Humans spontaneously select a step frequency that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking . This selection might be embedded within the neural circuits that generate gait so that the optimum is pre - programmed for a given walking speed . Or perhaps step frequency is directly optimized , based on sensed feedback of energy expenditure . Direct optimization is expected to be slow due to the compounded effect of delays and iteration , whereas a pre - programmed mechanism presumably allows for faster step frequency selection , albeit dependent on prior experience . To test for both pre - programmed selection and direct optimization , we applied perturbations to <font color="blue">treadmill_1</font> <font color="blue">walking_1</font> to elicit transient changes in step frequency . We found that <font color="blue">human_1</font> <font color="blue">step_1</font> <font color="blue">frequency_1</font> <font color="blue">adjustments_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">n_1</font> <font color="blue">=_1</font> <font color="blue">7_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> occurred with two components , the first dominating the response ( 66 ± 10% of total amplitude change ; mean ± SD ) and occurring quite quickly ( 1.44 ± 1.14 s to complete 95% of total change ) . The other component was of smaller amplitude ( 35 ± 10% of total change ) and took tens of seconds ( 27.56 ± 16.18 s for 95% completion ) . The fast process appeared to be too fast for direct optimization and more indicative of a pre - programmed response . It also persisted even with unusual closed - loop perturbations that conflicted with prior experience and rendered the response energetically suboptimal . The slow process was more consistent with the timing expected for direct optimization . Our interpretation of these results is that <font color="blue">humans_1</font> may rely heavily on pre - programmed gaits to rapidly select their preferred step frequency and then gradually fine - tune that selection with direct optimization .
