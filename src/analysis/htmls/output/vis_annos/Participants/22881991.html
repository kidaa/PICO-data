<br>
<br> BACKGROUND <font color="blue">Children_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">autism_1</font> have difficulties in emotion recognition and a number of interventions have been designed to target these problems . However , few emotion training interventions have been trialled with <font color="blue">young_1</font> <font color="blue">children_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">autism_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">co_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">morbid_1</font> <font color="blue">ID_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an emotion training programme for a <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">young_2</font> <font color="blue">children_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">autism_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">range_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">intellectual_2</font> <font color="blue">ability_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font>

Participants in the intervention group watched a DVD designed to teach emotion recognition skills to children with autism ( the Transporters ) , whereas the control group watched a DVD of Thomas the Tank Engine . Participants were assessed on their ability to complete basic emotion recognition tasks , mindreading and theory of mind ( TOM ) tasks before and after the 4-week intervention period , and at 3-month follow - up . 
<br> RESULTS Analyses controlled for the effect of chronological age , verbal intelligence , gender and DVD viewing time on outcomes . Children in the intervention group showed improved performance in the recognition of anger compared with the control group , with few improvements maintained at 3-month follow - up . There was no generalisation of skills to TOM or social skills . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The Transporters programme showed limited efficacy in teaching basic emotion recognition skills to <font color="blue">young_2</font> <font color="blue">children_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">autism_2</font> with a lower range of cognitive ability . Improvements were limited to the recognition of expressions of anger , with poor maintenance of these skills at follow - up . These findings provide limited support for the efficacy of the Transporters programme for <font color="blue">young_2</font> <font color="blue">children_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">autism_2</font> of a lower cognitive range .
