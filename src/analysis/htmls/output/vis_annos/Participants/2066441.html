The therapeutic effects of each treatment were compared both clinically and microbiologically . Records of plaque index , gingival index , bleeding on probing , probing depth , probing attachment level and microscopic counts were obtained at 0 , 4 , 6 and 8 weeks . The results showed marked decreases in probing depth and density of micro - organisms in both the RP and TC + RP groups . In particular , the TC + RP group was characterized by a decreased rate of bleeding on pocket probing and an increased probing attachment gain . The above findings demonstrated that root planning is effective in the <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">furcation_1</font> <font color="blue">involvement_1</font> and that the effects are enhanced by the local administration of TC films .
