Blood samples were collected after these periods , when <font color="blue">fish_2</font> were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia . Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control . Serum lactate levels were significantly high in 500 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control group . Lactate levels were not significantly differed between control , 3,000 , and 700 mg l⁻¹ groups . There were no significant differences in serum levels of cholesterol , total protein , lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , Na⁺ , Cl⁻ , K⁺ , and Ca²⁺. Results suggest that rapid anesthesia with higher dose is better than slow anesthesia with lower dose for blood sampling in <font color="blue">Beluga_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font>
