<br> The aim of this study was to compare a combination of Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) and galacto - oligosaccharides ( GOS ) with LGG on its own , and their effects on the <font color="blue">intestinal_1</font> <font color="blue">microbiota_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">school_4</font> <font color="blue">-_4</font> <font color="blue">aged_4</font> <font color="blue">children_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">randomized_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">double_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">blinded_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">crossover_1</font> <font color="blue">study_1</font> <font color="blue">comprised_1</font> <font color="blue">30_5</font> <font color="blue">healthy_5</font> <font color="blue">children_5</font> <font color="blue">._5</font> There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash - out period in between . The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk - based fruit juice containing either LGG alone ( 6.5 x 10(9 ) CFU ) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS . Symptom diaries were filled during the study periods . Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods . At the end of both study periods , the amount of bifidobacteria was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone ( geometric mean 9.33 x 10(9 ) vs. 4.28 x 10(9 ) CFU / g , p < 0.001 ) . No significant differences were seen in the amount of lactobacilli or LGG , nor did gastrointestinal symptoms , defecation frequency , consistency of stools or ease of defecation differ between the two study periods . Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the bifidobacteria more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a prebiotic effect in <font color="blue">children_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The <font color="blue">children_1</font> tolerated well a daily intake of 2 g of GOS .
