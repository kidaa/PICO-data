The treatment of <font color="blue">asthma_3</font> <font color="blue">in_3</font> <font color="blue">adults_3</font> using sodium cromoglycate pressurized aerosol : a double - blind controlled trial . 
<br>
<br> Sodium cromoglycate formulated as a pressurized aerosol ( 2 mg 4-times daily ) and placebo were compared in <font color="blue">31_5</font> <font color="blue">adult_5</font> <font color="blue">asthmatic_5</font> <font color="blue">patients_5</font> <font color="blue">in_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">double_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">blind_2</font> <font color="blue">crossover_2</font> <font color="blue">trial_2</font> <font color="blue">lasting_2</font> <font color="blue">12_2</font> <font color="blue">weeks_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Sodium cromoglycate was superior to placebo in improving breathlessness at rest ( p less than 0.001 ) , breathlessness on exertion ( p less than 0.05 ) and the quality of sleep ( p less than 0.001 ) , and also in improving the morning peak expiratory flow rate value ( p less than 0.05 ) . Both the patients ' ( p less than 0.05 ) and the clinicians ' ( p less than 0.01 ) treatment opinions , and their treatment preferences ( p less than 0.05 ) , favoured sodium cromoglycate . Moreover , usage of bronchodilators ( theophylline and aerosol beta - stimulants combined ) declined significantly ( p less than 0.001 ) during sodium cromoglycate treatment compared to placebo . No side - effects were reported . The results of this study show that sodium cromoglycate delivered by pressurized aerosol was significantly superior to placebo , not only in improving asthmatic symptoms , but also in reducing the amount of concomitant bronchodilator therapy required .
