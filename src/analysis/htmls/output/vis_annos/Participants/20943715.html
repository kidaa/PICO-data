<br>_1</font> OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of visual and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training on walking performance and to determine the clinical feasibility of incorporating auditory step rhythm into the training . 
<br> DESIGN Randomized crossover trial .

<br> INTERVENTION Four locomotor imagery trainings on walking performance : visual locomotor imagery training , kinesthetic locomotor imagery training , visual locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm and kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The timed up - and - go test and electromyographic and kinematic analyses of the affected lower limb during one gait cycle . 
<br> RESULTS After the interventions , significant differences were found in the timed up - and - go test results between the visual locomotor imagery training ( 25.69 ± 16.16 to 23.97 ± 14.30 ) and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm ( 22.68 ± 12.35 to 15.77 ± 8.58 ) ( P < 0.05 ) . During the swing and stance phases , the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training exhibited significantly increased activation in a greater number of muscles and increased angular displacement of the knee and ankle joints compared with the visual locomotor imagery training , and these effects were more prominent when auditory step rhythm was integrated into each form of locomotor imagery training . The activation of the hamstring during the swing phase and the gastrocnemius during the stance phase , as well as kinematic data of the knee joint , were significantly different for posttest values between the visual locomotor imagery training and the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training with auditory step rhythm ( P < 0.05 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic effect may be further enhanced in the kinesthetic locomotor imagery training than in the visual locomotor imagery training . The auditory step rhythm together with the locomotor imagery training produces a greater positive effect in improving the <font color="blue">walking_1</font> <font color="blue">performance_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">patients_4</font> <font color="blue">with_4</font> <font color="blue">post_4</font> <font color="blue">-_4</font> <font color="blue">stroke_4</font> <font color="blue">hemiparesis_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font>
