<br> BACKGROUND In the interest of preserving residual insulin secretory capacity present at the time of diagnosis <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">type_4</font> <font color="blue">1_4</font> <font color="blue">diabetes_4</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">T1D_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> we compared the efficacy of starting insulin pump therapy at diagnosis with standard multiple daily insulin injections ( MDIs ) . 
<br> METHODS We conducted a prospective , randomized , pilot trial comparing MDI therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy ( pump therapy ) in <font color="blue">24_7</font> <font color="blue">patients_7</font> <font color="blue">,_7</font> <font color="blue">8_7</font> <font color="blue">-_7</font> <font color="blue">18_7</font> <font color="blue">years_7</font> <font color="blue">old_7</font> <font color="blue">,_7</font> <font color="blue">with_7</font> <font color="blue">newly_7</font> <font color="blue">diagnosed_7</font> <font color="blue">T1D._7</font> <font color="blue">Subjects_1</font> <font color="blue">were_1</font> <font color="blue">evaluated_1</font> <font color="blue">at_1</font> <font color="blue">enrollment_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">1_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">3_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">6_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">9_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">12_1</font> <font color="blue">months_1</font> <font color="blue">after_1</font> <font color="blue">initial_1</font> <font color="blue">diagnosis_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">T1D._1</font> Preservation of insulin secretion , measured by mixed - meal - stimulated C - peptide secretion , was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment . Between - group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , continuous glucose sensor data , insulin utilization , anthropometric measures , and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points . 
<br> RESULTS Initiation of pump therapy within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed - meal tolerance test - stimulated C - peptide values at all time points , although these differences were not statistically significant . Nonetheless , improved glycemic control was observed in insulin pump - treated subjects ( more time spent with normoglycemia , better mean HbA1c ) , and pump - treated subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Initiation of insulin pump therapy at diagnosis improved glycemic control , was well tolerated , and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment . This study also suggests that earlier use of pump therapy might help to preserve residual β-cell function , although a larger clinical trial would be required to confirm this .
