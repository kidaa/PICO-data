<br> BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure , physical activity , sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of depression . However , to our knowledge , there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy .
