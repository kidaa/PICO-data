A novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled - release chlorhexidine delivery in <font color="blue">chronic_1</font> <font color="blue">periodontitis_1</font> <font color="blue">:_1</font> a randomized clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical , microbiologic , and serologic effects of chlorhexidine ( CHX ) chips used as a subgingival controlled - release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing ( SRP ) .

After prophylaxis , CHX chips ( test ) or placebo chips ( control ) were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm . Ten days later , SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment . Immediately after SRP , new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm . Parameters were assessed at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after treatment . Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and at 1 month after treatment . Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Prevotella intermedia , Tannerella forsythia , and Treponema denticola were analyzed . Serum levels of high sensitive C - reactive and lipopolysaccharide - binding proteins were measured . The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann - Whitney U test ( P < 0.05 ) . 
<br> RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time . There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level ( CAL ) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups ( 1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group ) ( P < 0.05 ) . The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the " red complex " after 1 month ( P = 0.02 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION The use of CHX chips before and immediately after SRP improved CAL and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis .
