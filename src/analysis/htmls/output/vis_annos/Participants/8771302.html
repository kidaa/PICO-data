<br> Fluoroscopy is a reliable , easy , and readily available technique to follow - up prosthesis functioning <font color="blue">after_1</font> <font color="blue">heart_1</font> <font color="blue">valve_1</font> <font color="blue">surgery_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The different orientation given to the prosthesis may represent a limitation of the technique accounting for unsatisfactory results in 10% to 40% of the cases . The aim of the study was to evaluate whether and to what extent different intraoperative valve orientation influence feasibility and accuracy of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluation of bileaflet prostheses . <font color="blue">We_1</font> <font color="blue">prospectively_1</font> <font color="blue">evaluated_1</font> <font color="blue">90_4</font> <font color="blue">patients_4</font> <font color="blue">who_4</font> <font color="blue">had_4</font> <font color="blue">aortic_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">mitral_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">and/or_4</font> <font color="blue">tricuspid_4</font> <font color="blue">valve_4</font> <font color="blue">replacement_4</font> <font color="blue">with_4</font> <font color="blue">Sorin_4</font> <font color="blue">Bicarbon_4</font> <font color="blue">or_4</font> <font color="blue">CarboMedics_4</font> <font color="blue">bileaflet_4</font> <font color="blue">prostheses_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> <font color="blue">Fifty_1</font> <font color="blue">percent_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">patients_1</font> in each group were randomly assigned to receive prostheses oriented in a perpendicular or a parallel position with respect to the ventricular septum . Fluoroscopic evaluation was considered appropriate when the prosthesis ' " tilting disk " projection was obtained . The valve 's hemodynamic performance was investigated through Doppler study . A proper fluoroscopic evaluation was rapidly ( 15 + /- 5 seconds ) achieved in all patients with the former orientation , whereas it was impossible to obtain it in 8 of 20 ( 40% ) , 19 of 20 ( 95% ) , and 4 of 5 ( 80% ) of patients with the latter orientation . In the remaining patients extremely angulated , uneasy projection was often required to get a correct fluoroscopic image . The Doppler study showed a similarly favorable hemodynamic performance regardless of valve orientation . Prosthesis orientation crucially affects the rate of success of the fluoroscopic evaluation . The orientation perpendicular to the ventricular septum greatly facilitates the postoperative feasibility and accuracy of fluoroscopy , and it is not detrimental to the valve 's hemodynamic performance . This valve orientation may provide a better fluoroscopic window whenever a <font color="blue">valve_1</font> <font color="blue">dysfunction_1</font> <font color="blue">is_1</font> <font color="blue">suspected_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
