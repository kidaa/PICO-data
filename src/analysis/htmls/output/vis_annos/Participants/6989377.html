<br> The fatty acid composition of the plasma lipid esters has been studied during lipid - lowering treatment of <font color="blue">95_5</font> <font color="blue">patients_5</font> <font color="blue">with_5</font> <font color="blue">atherosclerotic_6</font> <font color="blue">disease_6</font> <font color="blue">._6</font> During the first two months of the trial only a diet was prescribed . During the ensuing two months either clofibrate or niceritrol , a nicotinic acid ester , was added in a randomized order . During the last two months the second drug was added . The combined treatment with diet , clofibrate and niceritrol caused highly significant serum lipid reductions . The fatty acid composition in the plasma lipid esters was determined in samples from each trial period to measure the degree of dietary adherence . During dietary treatment the relative content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids secreased and the polyunsaturated fatty acids increased with an increasing ratio between pulyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids ( P / S ratio ) in the cholesterol esters and triglycerides . Only minor changes were seen in the phospholipids . The changes caused by the diet were partly reversed by clofibrate while niceritrol did not cause any major changes of the fatty acid composition . Clofibrate treatment coincided with increasing amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids , especially oleate ( 18 : 1 ) , in the cholesterol esters , triglycerides and phospholipids while there were significant reductions of the content of linoleic ( 18 : 2 ) acid in both the cholesterol esters and triglycerides . The 18 : 2/18 : 1 ratio decreased significantly in all the lipid esters analyzed . However , the P / S ratio was not significantly affected , partly because the relative content of saturated fatty acids also tended to decrease during clofibrate treatment . It is concluded that addition of clofibrate treatment to <font color="blue">patients_3</font> <font color="blue">who_3</font> <font color="blue">are_3</font> <font color="blue">on_3</font> <font color="blue">a_3</font> <font color="blue">diet_4</font> <font color="blue">enriched_4</font> <font color="blue">with_4</font> <font color="blue">polyunsaturated_4</font> <font color="blue">fats_4</font> is associated with a change from polyunsaturated to monounsaturated fatty acids in the plasma lipid esters but does not significantly effect the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids . The fatty acid changes caused by clofibrate treatment and counteracted by an increased amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet .
