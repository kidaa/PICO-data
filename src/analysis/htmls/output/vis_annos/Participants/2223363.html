The duration of induction was significantly longer ( P less than 0.001 ) with the slower infusion rates ( 104 , 68 and 51 s ) , but the total dose used was significantly less ( P less than 0.001 ) in these patients ( 1.2 , 1.6 and 2.5 mg kg-1 , respectively ) . The decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was significantly less in the 300-ml h-1 group at the end of induction and immediately after induction ( P less than 0.01 ) . The incidence of apnoea was also significantly less in the slower infusion group .
