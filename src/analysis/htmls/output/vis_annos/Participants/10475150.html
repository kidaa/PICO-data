<br>_1</font> Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species , which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion . Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown . We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in <font color="blue">8_7</font> <font color="blue">healthy_7</font> <font color="blue">volunteers_7</font> <font color="blue">,_7</font> <font color="blue">and_6</font> <font color="blue">6_7</font> <font color="blue">women_7</font> <font color="blue">with_7</font> <font color="blue">untreated_7</font> <font color="blue">primary_7</font> <font color="blue">hypothyroidism_7</font> <font color="blue">,_7</font> <font color="blue">a_3</font> <font color="blue">disease_3</font> <font color="blue">state_3</font> <font color="blue">that_3</font> <font color="blue">is_3</font> <font color="blue">associated_3</font> <font color="blue">with_3</font> <font color="blue">increased_3</font> <font color="blue">nocturnal_3</font> <font color="blue">secretion_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide ( Sandostatin ; each injection 50 microg ) . During the nights when the <font color="blue">healthy_2</font> <font color="blue">volunteers_2</font> were given octreotide , melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline . Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions . By contrast , the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide ( GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU / l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.01 ) . <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">patients_2</font> <font color="blue">with_2</font> <font color="blue">hypothyroidism_2</font> also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during octreotide and saline . Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged , as did GH secretion . The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was , however , significantly reduced by octreotide ( TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU / l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.05 ) , thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin . Since exogenous somatostatin -- in the form of octreotide -- fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in <font color="blue">normal_3</font> <font color="blue">subjects_3</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">in_2</font> <font color="blue">patients_3</font> <font color="blue">with_3</font> <font color="blue">primary_3</font> <font color="blue">hypothyroidism_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man .
