<br>_1</font> Melatonin , the hormone produced nocturnally by the <font color="blue">pineal_1</font> <font color="blue">gland_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> is an endogenous regulator of the <font color="blue">sleep_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">wake_1</font> <font color="blue">cycle_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The effects of melatonin on brain activities and their relation to induction of sleepiness were studied in a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study . Melatonin , but not placebo , reduced task - related activity in the rostro - medial aspect of the occipital cortex during a visual - search task and in the auditory cortex during a music task . These effects correlated with subjective measurements of fatigue . In addition , melatonin enhanced the activation in the left parahippocampus in an autobiographic memory task . Results demonstrate that melatonin modulates <font color="blue">brain_1</font> activity in a manner resembling actual sleep although <font color="blue">subjects_1</font> are fully awake . Furthermore , the fatigue inducing effect of melatonin on <font color="blue">brain_1</font> activity is essentially different from that of sleep deprivation thus revealing differences between fatigues related to the circadian sleep regulation as opposed to increased homeostatic sleep need . Our findings highlight the role of melatonin in priming <font color="blue">sleep_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">associated_1</font> <font color="blue">brain_2</font> <font color="blue">activation_1</font> <font color="blue">patterns_1</font> in anticipation of sleep .
