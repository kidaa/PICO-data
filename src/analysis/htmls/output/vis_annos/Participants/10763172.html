Confirmatory statistical analysis was carried out according to Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney - U two - sided at alpha < or = 0.05 . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The superiority of the combination of Xylometazoline - Dexpanthenol nasal - spray versus Xylometazoline nasal spray could be proven for the target - parameter as clinically relevant and statistically significant . The clinically proven efficacy is emphasized by good tolerability of both treatments . Due to easy handling of the nasal - spray a good compliance was confirmed . 
<br> CONCLUSION Distinct improvement of symptoms in <font color="blue">patients_2</font> <font color="blue">following_2</font> <font color="blue">nasal_2</font> <font color="blue">operations_2</font> underlines the efficacy of both medications . With respect to the tolerability therapy with the combination is more beneficial in comparison to the alternative therapy . The result of this controlled clinical study confirms that the combination Xylometazoline - Dexpanthenol is an enlargement and improvement of effective medicinal treatment of <font color="blue">rhinitis_2</font> <font color="blue">following_2</font> <font color="blue">nasal_2</font> <font color="blue">operation_2</font> in comparison to therapy with Xylometazoline alone .
