No <font color="blue">patient_1</font> received antibiotics at the time of surgery or prior to the first positive blood culture , yet B. fragilis was the single organism isolated from blood and abscesses in these <font color="blue">patients_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> A role for lymphocytes in containment of B. fragilis has not been suggested previously , although unexplained occurrence of bacteroides bacteremia in <font color="blue">immunocompromised_1</font> <font color="blue">patients_1</font> has occasionally been reported . Lymphocytes themselves may be important in this host - bacterium interaction , or lymphocytopenia may be the marker for a more generalized deficiency in host defenses .
