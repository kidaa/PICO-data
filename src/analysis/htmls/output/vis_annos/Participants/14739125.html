Raising high - density lipoprotein in <font color="blue">humans_1</font> through inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein : an initial multidose study of torcetrapib . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE The ability of the potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) inhibitor torcetrapib ( CP-529,414 ) to raise high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) levels in <font color="blue">healthy_6</font> <font color="blue">young_6</font> <font color="blue">subjects_6</font> was tested in this initial phase 1 multidose study . 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS <font color="blue">Five_6</font> <font color="blue">groups_6</font> <font color="blue">of_6</font> <font color="blue">8_6</font> <font color="blue">subjects_6</font> <font color="blue">each_4</font> <font color="blue">were_1</font> <font color="blue">randomized_1</font> to placebo ( n=2 ) or torcetrapib ( n=6 ) at 10 , 30 , 60 , and 120 mg daily and 120 mg twice daily for 14 days . Torcetrapib was well tolerated , with all treated subjects completing the study . The correlation of plasma drug levels with inhibition ( EC50=43 nM ) was as expected based on in vitro potency ( IC50 approximately 50 nM ) , and increases in CETP mass were consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition . CETP inhibition increased with escalating dose , leading to elevations of HDL - C of 16% to 91% . Total plasma cholesterol did not change significantly because of a reduction in nonHDL - C , including a 21% to 42% lowering of low - density lipoprotein cholesterol at the higher doses . Apolipoprotein A - I and E were elevated 27% and 66% , respectively , and apoB was reduced 26% with 120 mg twice daily . Cholesteryl ester content decreased and triglyceride increased in the nonHDL plasma fraction , with contrasting changes occurring in HDL . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS These effects of CETP inhibition resemble those observed in partial CETP deficiency . This work serves as a prelude to further studies in subjects with low HDL , or combinations of dyslipidemia , in assessing the role of CETP in atherosclerosis .
