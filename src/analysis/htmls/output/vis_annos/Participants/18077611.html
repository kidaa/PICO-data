Varicella - zoster virus ( VZV ) antibody responses were measured by a glycoprotein enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( gpELISA ) . The primary endpoints were the VZV antibody geometric mean titer ( GMT ; day 28 ) , the VZV antibody geometric mean rise ( GMR ; days 1 to 28 ) , and the incidence of vaccine - related serious adverse experiences ( AEs ) over 28 days . The refrigerated ( n = 182 ) and frozen ( n = 185 ) formulations induced similar GMTs ( 727.4 and 834.4 gpELISA units / ml , respectively ) ; the estimated GMT ratio ( refrigerated formulation / frozen formulation ) was 0.87 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.71 to 1.07 ) . The GMRs were 2.6- and 2.9-fold , respectively . No vaccine - related serious AEs were reported in either group , and the safety profiles of the formulations were generally similar . The frequencies of injection - site AEs during follow - up were 35.6% and 46.4% in the refrigerated and the frozen formulation groups , respectively , and were generally mild . The frequencies of systemic AEs were similar in the two groups , and those of vaccine - related AEs were approximately 6% in both groups . The refrigerator - stable formulation of Zostavax has an acceptable safety profile and is as immunogenic as the frozen formulation ; thus , the vaccine may be used in clinical settings where freezer availability is limited .
