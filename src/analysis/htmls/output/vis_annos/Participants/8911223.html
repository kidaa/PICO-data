<br> BACKGROUND Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction , impairments in communication , and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests . Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism . No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism . 
<br> METHODS <font color="blue">Thirty_3</font> <font color="blue">adults_3</font> <font color="blue">with_3</font> <font color="blue">autistic_3</font> <font color="blue">disorder_3</font> completed a 12-week double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate . Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks of treatment . 
<br> RESULTS Eight ( 53% ) of <font color="blue">15_1</font> <font color="blue">patients_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">fluvoxamine_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">treated_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> <font color="blue">were_1</font> <font color="blue">categorized_1</font> <font color="blue">as_1</font> <font color="blue">responders_1</font> <font color="blue">compared_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">none_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">15_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">placebo_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> ( P = .001 ) . Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior ( P < .001 ) , maladaptive behavior ( P < .001 ) , and aggression ( P < .03 ) , and in improving some aspects of social relatedness ( P < .04 ) , especially language usage ( P < .008 ) . Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior , or full - scale IQ . Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients , fluvoxamine was well tolerated . No dyskinesias , adverse cardiovascular events , or seizures occurred . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short - term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults . Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism .
