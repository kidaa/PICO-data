The overall response rate ( CR+PR ) was 91.5% for Chinese herb group and 46.9% for control group ( P less than 0.001 ) . The median survival was 16 months for the traditional Chinese Kidney - tonifying decoction group , and 10 months for the control group ( P less than 0.05 ) . Survival curve ( Kaplan - meire 's ) of the Chinese herb group was better than that of the control group . 10 patients of Chinese herb group was alive beyond more than 2 years . Until now , 4 patients in the Chinese herb group , one in the control group are still enjoying their disease - free life for more than 7 years . Hematologic toxicities were observed much frequently in the patients of the control group ( P less than 0.005 and 0.01/WBC and BPC ) . Results of animal experiments with the same traditional medicinal decoctions as used in clinic have showed immuno - enhancement activities . These results have showed that the traditional Chinese Kidney - tonifying decoction may enhance non - specific immunology activities and may be much useful for <font color="blue">solid_3</font> <font color="blue">cancer_3</font> <font color="blue">patients_3</font> as an adjuvant treatment .
