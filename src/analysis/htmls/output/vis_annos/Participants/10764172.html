<br> PURPOSE The effects of morphine on natural killer ( NK ) cell activity were investigated in <font color="blue">patients_6</font> <font color="blue">who_6</font> <font color="blue">underwent_6</font> <font color="blue">hysterectomy_6</font> <font color="blue">._6</font> 
<br> METHODS <font color="blue">Forty_6</font> <font color="blue">patients_6</font> <font color="blue">were_3</font> <font color="blue">divided_3</font> <font color="blue">into_3</font> <font color="blue">four_3</font> <font color="blue">groups_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">ten_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> The groups received intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine ( Group IT0.5 ) , intrathecal 0.1 mg morphine ( Group IT0.1 ) or 10 mg morphine i.v . ( Group IV ) . The remaining ten patients served as controls and received inhalation anesthesia alone ( Group C ) . Blood samples were withdrawn before and two hours after surgery and on postoperative days one and two to determine the blood NK cell activity using a chromium release assay with K562 cells as targets , plasma catecholamines and cortisol levels . The postoperative pain score and side effects were studied in the four groups . 
<br> RESULTS In Group IT0.5 , the NK cell activity was lower on postoperative day 1 ( 23.9 + /- 8.4% ) than the baseline level ( 45.7 + /- 13% ) before surgery , and recovered on postoperative day 2 . In Groups IT0.1 , C and IV , the NK cell activities showed no significant changes . In all four groups , neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed . In all four groups , the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery , on postoperative days 1 and 2 . The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups . 
<br> CONCLUSION These results suggest that long - lasting analgesic effects of intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine suppress the immune response following abdominal surgery .
