<br> INTRODUCTION This study examined whether ( 1 ) <font color="blue">postmenopausal_1</font> <font color="blue">breast_1</font> <font color="blue">cancer_1</font> <font color="blue">survivors_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">BCS_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">bone_1</font> <font color="blue">loss_1</font> taking 24 months of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D had increased bone mineral density ( BMD ) at the total hip , femoral neck , L1-L4 spine , total radius and 33% radius , and decreased bone turnover ; ( 2 ) subjects who also participated in strength / weight training ( ST ) exercises had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover ; and ( 3 ) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve ( at least maintain ) BMD . 
<br> METHODS <font color="blue">Postmenopausal_2</font> <font color="blue">BCS_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">223_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> were randomly assigned to <font color="blue">exercise_1</font> <font color="blue">plus_1</font> <font color="blue">medication_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">medication_1</font> <font color="blue">only_1</font> <font color="blue">groups_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly , and the exercise group additionally had ST exercises twice weekly . 
<br> RESULTS After 24 months , women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip ( + 1.81% ) and spine ( + 2.85% ) and significant decreases in Alkphase B ( -8.7% ) and serum NTx ( -16.7% ) . Women who also exercised had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck ( + 0.29% ) , total hip ( + 0.34% ) , spine ( + 0.23% ) , total radius ( + 0.30% ) , and additional decreases in Alkphase B ( -2.4% ) and Serum NTx ( -6.5% ) . Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with exercise were not significant . <font color="blue">Subjects_1</font> who were > or = 50% adherent to exercise were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.66 , p = 0.03 ) and femoral neck ( chi - square [ 1 ] = 4.63 , p = 0.03 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION Strength / weight training exercises may prevent loss of BMD in postmenopausal BCS at risk for bone loss .
