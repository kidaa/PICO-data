<br>
<br> This randomized , open - label study compared the investigational inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane with isoflurane in <font color="blue">47_1</font> <font color="blue">healthy_1</font> <font color="blue">women_1</font> <font color="blue">undergoing_1</font> <font color="blue">elective_1</font> <font color="blue">ambulatory_1</font> <font color="blue">surgery_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">women_1</font> were randomized to receive either sevoflurane or isoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide - oxygen . Induction with thiopental 3 - 6 mg / kg was followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg / kg and fentanyl 0 - 200 micrograms . Duration of anesthesia , time to emergence , orientation , length of stay in the surgical unit , and hospital discharge were recorded . The emergence , length of stay , and discharge times after discontinuation of sevoflurane were 9.7 + /- 0.7 , 120.6 + /- 8.0 , and 244 + /- 15 minutes , respectively , and for isoflurane were 11.9 + /- 1.4 , 106.8 + /- 7.1 , and 282 + /- 24 minutes , respectively ( NS ) . <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">isoflurane_1</font> <font color="blue">group_1</font> had a higher frequency of postoperative cough . At the end of surgery , the sevoflurane group received a deeper level of anesthesia ( minimum alveolar concentration 1.5 vs 1.3 ) , however , these patients were oriented earlier ( 13.6 + /- 1.1 min vs 17.0 + /- 1.5 min isoflurane ; p = 0.02 ) after discontinuation of anesthesia , although this difference is of little clinical significance .
