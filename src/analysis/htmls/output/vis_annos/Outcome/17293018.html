The <font color="blue">safety_1</font> of whey protein concentrate derived from the milk of cows immunized against Clostridium difficile . 
<br>
<br> A whey protein concentrate prepared from the milk of cows that have been immunized against Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) and its toxins , toxin A and toxin B , is produced for use as a medical food for the dietary management of patients with C. difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) to prevent a relapse of the infection . The safety of anti - C. difficile whey protein concentrate ( anti - CD WPC ) is supported by <font color="blue">analytical_1</font> <font color="blue">data_1</font> comparing the composition of raw milk from immunized cows versus that from non - immunized cows , and the composition of anti - CD WPC versus that of regular whey protein concentrate . Additionally , a prospective clinical study was conducted in 77 patients with CDAD to demonstrate the <font color="blue">safety_1</font> of consuming anti - CD WPC to prevent relapse of the infection . This study , which included <font color="blue">adverse_1</font> <font color="blue">event_1</font> <font color="blue">monitoring_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">physical_1</font> <font color="blue">examinations_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">extensive_1</font> <font color="blue">hematological_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">biochemical_1</font> <font color="blue">assessments_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> showed that anti - CD WPC is <font color="blue">safe_1</font> to consume by patients with CDAD . The available analytical and clinical evidence demonstrate that anti - CD WPC is <font color="blue">safe_2</font> for use by individuals with CDAD , under the described conditions of use .
