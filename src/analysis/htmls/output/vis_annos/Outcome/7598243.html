<br>
<br> The prophylactic antiemetic efficacy of intravenous ( i.v . ) ondansetron , droperidol , perphenazine , and metoclopramide was evaluated in a prospective , double - blind study of 360 ASA physical status I - III patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy ( TAH ) . Subjects were randomized to receive i.v . , one of ondansetron 4 mg , droperidol 1.25 mg , perphenazine 5 mg , metoclopramide 10 mg , or placebo prior to induction of anesthesia . <font color="blue">Hypotension_1</font> immediately after administration of metoclopramide was observed in two patients and four patients given ondansetron developed profound systolic hypotension at induction of anesthesia . Twenty - two percent of patients receiving droperidol became sedated . Postoperatively , patients developing <font color="blue">severe_3</font> <font color="blue">nausea_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">retching_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">or_3</font> <font color="blue">vomiting_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> defined as severe emetic sequelae ( SES ) , were deemed to have failed antiemetic prophylaxis and received antiemetic rescue . A significantly larger number of patients who received i.v . ondansetron ( 63% ) , droperidol ( 76% ) , and perphenazine ( 70% ) were free of SES when compared to placebo ( 43% ) ; P < 0.05 . Metoclopramide was <font color="blue">ineffective_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Although ondansetron , droperidol , and perphenazine were <font color="blue">effective_1</font> in providing <font color="blue">antiemetic_2</font> <font color="blue">prophylaxis_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> only i.v . perphenazine was <font color="blue">free_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">side_1</font> <font color="blue">effects_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Hence , we conclude that perphenazine is the <font color="blue">best_1</font> <font color="blue">choice_1</font> <font color="blue">for_1</font> <font color="blue">antiemetic_1</font> <font color="blue">prophylaxis_1</font> after TAH .
