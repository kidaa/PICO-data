<br> Children acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things , but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired . In this article , it is <font color="blue">proposed_1</font> that children <font color="blue">acquire_1</font> <font color="blue">generic_1</font> <font color="blue">knowledge_1</font> <font color="blue">by_1</font> <font color="blue">sharing_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">pretend_1</font> <font color="blue">play_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> In Experiment 1 , twenty - two 3- to 4-year - olds watched pretense in which a puppet represented a " nerp " ( an unfamiliar kind of animal ) .

When subsequently asked generic questions about real nerps , <font color="blue">children_1</font> <font color="blue">'s_1</font> <font color="blue">responses_2</font> <font color="blue">suggested_1</font> <font color="blue">that_1</font> <font color="blue">they_1</font> <font color="blue">had_1</font> <font color="blue">learned_2</font> <font color="blue">general_3</font> <font color="blue">facts_3</font> ( e.g. , nerps dislike carrots ) .
