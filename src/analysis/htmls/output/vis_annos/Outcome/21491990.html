A novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled - release chlorhexidine delivery in <font color="blue">chronic_1</font> <font color="blue">periodontitis_1</font> <font color="blue">:_1</font> a randomized clinical trial . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND We aimed to <font color="blue">analyze_1</font> <font color="blue">clinical_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">microbiologic_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">serologic_1</font> <font color="blue">effects_1</font> of chlorhexidine ( CHX ) chips used as a subgingival controlled - release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing ( SRP ) . 
<br> METHODS Twenty - four patients presenting with ≥12 teeth with probing depth ( PD ) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups . After prophylaxis , CHX chips ( test ) or placebo chips ( control ) were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm . Ten days later , SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment . Immediately after SRP , new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm . Parameters were assessed at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after treatment . <font color="blue">Subgingival_2</font> <font color="blue">samples_2</font> were obtained at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and at 1 month after treatment . <font color="blue">Periodontal_2</font> <font color="blue">pathogens_2</font> <font color="blue">Aggregatibacter_2</font> <font color="blue">actinomycetemcomitans_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">Porphyromonas_2</font> <font color="blue">gingivalis_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">Prevotella_2</font> <font color="blue">intermedia_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">Tannerella_2</font> <font color="blue">forsythia_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">Treponema_2</font> <font color="blue">denticola_2</font> were analyzed . <font color="blue">Serum_1</font> <font color="blue">levels_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">high_2</font> <font color="blue">sensitive_2</font> <font color="blue">C_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">reactive_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">lipopolysaccharide_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">binding_2</font> <font color="blue">proteins_2</font> were measured . The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by <font color="blue">Mann_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">Whitney_2</font> <font color="blue">U_2</font> <font color="blue">test_2</font> ( P < 0.05 ) . 
<br> RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time . There was a significant difference in <font color="blue">clinical_1</font> <font color="blue">attachment_1</font> <font color="blue">level_1</font> <font color="blue">(_1</font> <font color="blue">CAL_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> <font color="blue">gain_1</font> from baseline to 6 months between groups ( 1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group ) ( P < 0.05 ) . The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the " <font color="blue">red_1</font> <font color="blue">complex_1</font> <font color="blue">"_1</font> after 1 month ( P = 0.02 ) . 
<br> CONCLUSION The use of CHX chips before and immediately after SRP improved CAL and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic <font color="blue">periodontitis_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
