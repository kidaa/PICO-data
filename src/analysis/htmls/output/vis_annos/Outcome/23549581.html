<br>
<br> IMPORTANCE There are no known effective treatments for <font color="blue">painful_1</font> <font color="blue">chemotherapy_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">induced_1</font> <font color="blue">peripheral_1</font> <font color="blue">neuropathy_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of duloxetine , 60 mg daily , <font color="blue">on_1</font> <font color="blue">average_1</font> <font color="blue">pain_2</font> <font color="blue">severity_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br> DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover trial at 8 National Cancer Institute ( NCI)-funded cooperative research networks that enrolled 231 patients who were 25 years or older being treated at community and academic settings between April 2008 and March 2011 . Study follow - up was completed July 2012 . Stratified by <font color="blue">chemotherapeutic_1</font> <font color="blue">drug_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">comorbid_1</font> <font color="blue">pain_1</font> <font color="blue">risk_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> patients were randomized to receive either duloxetine followed by placebo or placebo followed by duloxetine . Eligibility required that patients have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 , representing average chemotherapy - induced <font color="blue">pain_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> after paclitaxel , other taxane , or oxaliplatin treatment . 
<br> INTERVENTIONS The initial treatment consisted of taking 1 capsule daily of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo for the first week and 2 capsules of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo daily for 4 additional weeks . 
<br> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary hypothesis was that duloxetine would be more effective than placebo in decreasing <font color="blue">chemotherapy_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">induced_2</font> <font color="blue">peripheral_3</font> <font color="blue">neuropathic_3</font> <font color="blue">pain_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> <font color="blue">Pain_5</font> <font color="blue">severity_4</font> was assessed using the <font color="blue">Brief_1</font> <font color="blue">Pain_1</font> <font color="blue">Inventory_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">Short_1</font> <font color="blue">Form_1</font> <font color="blue">"_1</font> <font color="blue">average_1</font> <font color="blue">pain_2</font> <font color="blue">"_2</font> <font color="blue">item_1</font> with 0 representing no <font color="blue">pain_2</font> and 10 representing as bad as can be imagined . 
<br> RESULTS Individuals receiving duloxetine as their initial 5-week treatment reported a <font color="blue">mean_1</font> <font color="blue">decrease_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">average_2</font> <font color="blue">pain_3</font> of 1.06 ( 95% CI , 0.72 - 1.40 ) vs 0.34 ( 95% CI , 0.01 - 0.66 ) among those who received placebo ( P = .003 ; effect size , 0.513 ) . The observed mean difference in the <font color="blue">average_3</font> <font color="blue">pain_3</font> <font color="blue">score_3</font> between duloxetine and placebo was 0.73 ( 95% CI , 0.26 - 1.20 ) . Fifty - nine percent of those initially receiving duloxetine vs 38% of those initially receiving placebo reported <font color="blue">decreased_1</font> <font color="blue">pain_3</font> of any amount . 
<br> CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among patients with painful chemotherapy - induced peripheral neuropathy , the use of duloxetine compared with placebo for 5 weeks resulted in a <font color="blue">greater_1</font> <font color="blue">reduction_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">pain_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font>
