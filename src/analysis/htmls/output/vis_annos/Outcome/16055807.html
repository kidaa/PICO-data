<br> METHOD Comprehensive cognitive - behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the " early initial prodromal state " . For patients in the " late initial prodromal state " the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored . Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition . 
<br> RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003 , 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres . More than 388 individuals <font color="blue">fulfilled_1</font> <font color="blue">criteria_1</font> for both interventions and 188 ( 48.5% ) gave <font color="blue">informed_2</font> <font color="blue">consent_2</font> to participate in the trials . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The <font color="blue">screening_1</font> <font color="blue">procedure_1</font> appears to be feasible and <font color="blue">trial_1</font> <font color="blue">participation_1</font> seems to be <font color="blue">acceptable_1</font> to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis .
