Comparison of budesonide Turbuhaler with budesonide aqua in the treatment of <font color="blue">seasonal_1</font> <font color="blue">allergic_1</font> <font color="blue">rhinitis_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Rhinocort Study Group . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of budesonide Turbuhaler 400 microg / day with budesonide aqua 256 microg / day in the treatment of <font color="blue">seasonal_1</font> <font color="blue">allergic_1</font> <font color="blue">rhinitis_1</font> ( SAR ) . Secondarily to ascertain <font color="blue">patients_1</font> <font color="blue">'_1</font> <font color="blue">preferences_1</font> for the two nasal devices and to assess <font color="blue">quality_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">life_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> DESIGN Randomized , multicentre , double - blind , double- dummy , parallel groups study . 
<br> SETTING Private practices and hospital clinics in Ontario , Quebec and Manitoba . 
<br> POPULATION Two hundred and eighty - four out - patients with SAR , who were symptomatic during the ragweed season , volunteered for enrolment ( 243 randomized ) . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="blue">Mean_1</font> <font color="blue">daily_3</font> <font color="blue">nasal_3</font> <font color="blue">symptom_3</font> <font color="blue">scores_3</font> were significantly reduced with treatment . There were no statistically significant changes from baseline for <font color="blue">eye_1</font> <font color="blue">symptoms_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Most patients ( more than 80% ) achieved substantial control of their symptoms with budesonide . The most common <font color="blue">nasal_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">non_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">nasal_1</font> <font color="blue">adverse_1</font> <font color="blue">events_1</font> for both groups were <font color="blue">epistaxis_2</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">headache_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Turbuhaler was easier to use and more convenient to carry , had less of an unpleasant taste , and caused less nasal irritation than the aqua spray . More than twice as many patients preferred Turbuhaler to the aqua spray ( 69% versus 31% ) . Improvement in <font color="blue">quality_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">life_1</font> from baseline to clinic visits was statistically significant in both groups . 
<br> CONCLUSION Once daily use of 256 mg of budesonide aqua and 400 mg of budesonide Turbuhaler are <font color="blue">equally_1</font> <font color="blue">safe_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">efficacious_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">SAR_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Patients preferred the budesonide powder formulation delivered via Turbuhaler two to one over the aqua formulation .
