Eltrombopag for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( RAISE ) : a 6-month , randomised , phase 3 study . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist for the treatment of thrombocytopenia . We aimed to compare the <font color="blue">response_2</font> to once daily eltrombopag versus placebo in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia during a 6-month period . 
<br> METHODS We undertook a phase 3 , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months ' duration who had baseline <font color="blue">platelet_1</font> <font color="blue">counts_1</font> lower than 30,000 per μL. Patients were randomly allocated ( in a 2:1 ratio ) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months . Randomisation was done centrally with a computer - generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline <font color="blue">platelet_2</font> <font color="blue">count_2</font> ( ≤ 15,000 per μL ) , use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia , and splenectomy status . Patients , investigators , and those assessing data were masked to allocation . Dose modifications were made on the basis of <font color="blue">platelet_3</font> <font color="blue">response_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> Patients were assessed for <font color="blue">response_4</font> <font color="blue">to_4</font> <font color="blue">treatment_4</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">defined_2</font> <font color="blue">as_2</font> <font color="blue">a_2</font> <font color="blue">platelet_2</font> <font color="blue">count_2</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">50,000_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">400,000_1</font> <font color="blue">per_1</font> <font color="blue">μL_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter ; the primary endpoint was <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">odds_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">response_3</font> to eltrombopag versus placebo . Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00370331 . 
<br> FINDINGS Between Nov 22 , 2006 , and July 31 , 2007 , 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention - to - treat analysis ( 135 eltrombopag , 62 placebo ) . 106 ( 79% ) patients in the eltrombopag group <font color="blue">responded_3</font> <font color="blue">to_2</font> <font color="blue">treatment_2</font> at least once during the study , compared with 17 ( 28% ) patients in the placebo group . The <font color="blue">odds_5</font> <font color="blue">of_5</font> <font color="blue">responding_5</font> were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period ( odds ratio 8·2 , 99% CI 3·59 - 18·73 ; p<0·0001 ) . 37 ( 59% ) patients receiving eltrombopag <font color="blue">reduced_1</font> <font color="blue">concomitant_4</font> <font color="blue">treatment_4</font> versus ten ( 32% ) patients receiving placebo ( p=0·016 ) . 24 ( 18% ) patients receiving eltrombopag <font color="blue">needed_1</font> <font color="blue">rescue_4</font> <font color="blue">treatment_4</font> compared with 25 ( 40% ) patients receiving placebo ( p=0·001 ) . Three ( 2% ) patients receiving eltrombopag had <font color="blue">thromboembolic_5</font> <font color="blue">events_5</font> compared with none in patients on placebo . Nine ( 7% ) eltrombopag - treated patients and two ( 3% ) in the placebo group had <font color="blue">mild_1</font> <font color="blue">increases_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">alanine_4</font> <font color="blue">aminotransferase_4</font> <font color="blue">concentration_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> and five ( 4% ) eltrombopag - treated patients ( vs none allocated to placebo ) had <font color="blue">increases_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">total_4</font> <font color="blue">bilirubin_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> Four ( 7% ) patients taking placebo had <font color="blue">serious_5</font> <font color="blue">bleeding_5</font> <font color="blue">events_5</font> <font color="blue">,_5</font> compared with one ( < 1% ) patient treated with eltrombopag . 
<br> INTERPRETATION Eltrombopag is <font color="blue">effective_2</font> <font color="blue">for_1</font> <font color="blue">management_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">chronic_1</font> <font color="blue">immune_1</font> <font color="blue">thrombocytopenia_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment . These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with eltrombopag treatment .
