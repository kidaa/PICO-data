The role of somatostatin ( octreotide ) in the regulation of <font color="blue">melatonin_2</font> <font color="blue">secretion_2</font> in healthy volunteers and in patients with primary hypothyroidism . 
<br>
<br> Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species , which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of <font color="blue">melatonin_1</font> <font color="blue">secretion_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on <font color="blue">melatonin_1</font> <font color="blue">secretion_1</font> in man has never been unequivocally shown . We <font color="blue">studied_1</font> the <font color="blue">nocturnal_1</font> <font color="blue">melatonin_1</font> <font color="blue">secretion_1</font> in 8 healthy volunteers , and 6 women with untreated primary hypothyroidism , a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin . The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide ( Sandostatin ; each injection 50 microg ) . During the nights when the healthy volunteers were given octreotide , <font color="blue">melatonin_2</font> <font color="blue">secretion_2</font> was similar to that recorded during administration of saline . Also the <font color="blue">urinary_3</font> <font color="blue">excretion_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> was of <font color="blue">similar_1</font> magnitude at these two occasions . By contrast , the <font color="blue">GH_3</font> <font color="blue">secretion_3</font> was <font color="blue">significantly_1</font> <font color="blue">lower_1</font> the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide ( GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU / l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.01 ) . The patients with hypothyroidism also <font color="blue">showed_1</font> <font color="blue">similar_1</font> <font color="blue">nocturnal_3</font> <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> <font color="blue">secretion_3</font> during octreotide and saline . <font color="blue">Urinary_3</font> <font color="blue">excretion_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> also <font color="blue">remained_1</font> <font color="blue">unchanged_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> as did <font color="blue">GH_1</font> <font color="blue">secretion_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The <font color="blue">total_4</font> <font color="blue">nocturnal_5</font> <font color="blue">secretion_5</font> <font color="blue">of_5</font> <font color="blue">TSH_5</font> was , however , <font color="blue">significantly_1</font> <font color="blue">reduced_1</font> by octreotide ( TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU / l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU / l x h during saline ; p<0.05 ) , thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin . Since exogenous somatostatin -- in the form of octreotide -- fails to influence <font color="blue">nocturnal_3</font> <font color="blue">secretion_3</font> <font color="blue">and_3</font> <font color="blue">urinary_3</font> <font color="blue">excretion_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">melatonin_3</font> in normal subjects and in patients with primary hypothyroidism , it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of <font color="blue">melatonin_2</font> <font color="blue">secretion_2</font> in man .
