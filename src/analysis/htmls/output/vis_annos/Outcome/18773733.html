Vibrotactile -- auditory interactions are post - perceptual . 
<br>
<br> Vibrotactile stimuli can elicit compelling <font color="blue">auditory_1</font> <font color="blue">sensations_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> even when sound energy levels are minimal and undetectable . It has previously been shown that subjects judge auditory tones embedded in white noise to be louder when they are accompanied by a vibrotactile stimulus of the same frequency . A first experiment replicated this result at four different levels of <font color="blue">auditory_1</font> <font color="blue">stimulation_1</font> ( no tone , tone at detection threshold , tone at 5 dB above threshold , and tone at 10 dB above threshold ) . The presence of a <font color="blue">vibrotactile_1</font> <font color="blue">stimulus_1</font> induced an <font color="blue">increase_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">perceived_1</font> <font color="blue">loudness_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">auditory_2</font> <font color="blue">tones_2</font> at three of the four values in this range . In two further experiments , a <font color="blue">2-interval_1</font> <font color="blue">forced_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">choice_1</font> <font color="blue">procedure_1</font> was used to assess <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">nature_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">this_1</font> <font color="blue">cross_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">modal_1</font> <font color="blue">interaction_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Subjects were biased when vibrotaction was applied in one interval , but applying <font color="blue">vibrotaction_1</font> in both intervals produced performance comparable to conditions without vibrotactile stimuli . This demonstrates that vibrotaction is sometimes ignored when judging the presence of an auditory tone . Hence the interaction between vibrotaction and audition does not appear to occur at an early perceptual level .
