[ The effect of ionic and nonionic x - ray contrast media on myocardial perfusion and myocardial function ] . 
<br>
<br> The influence of injections of Amidotrizoate and Iopromide into the left coronary artery on <font color="blue">global_1</font> <font color="blue">myocardial_1</font> <font color="blue">perfusion_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">function_1</font> ( pressures in the left ventricle , heart rate ) as well as excitation formation and transmission was studied in 16 patients with ischaemic heart disease . No statistically significant differences in <font color="blue">myocardial_3</font> <font color="blue">perfusion_3</font> measured were found with xenon-133 in this small group between rest and dipyridamole load for ionic and non - ionic contrast media .
