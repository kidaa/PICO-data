Long - term survival in a phase III , randomised study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND We have continued to monitor the survival of patients randomised in a previously reported multicentre phase III study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in patients with <font color="blue">advanced_1</font> <font color="blue">epithelial_1</font> <font color="blue">ovarian_1</font> <font color="blue">cancer_1</font> who had failed one prior platinum - based regimen . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were randomised to topotecan ( 1.5 mg / m(2)/day for 5 days ) or paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m(2)/day as a 3-h infusion ) every 21 days . Patients were eligible for treatment with the alternate therapy at third line .

<br> RESULTS A total of 226 patients were evaluable for response . Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups , as were results of the <font color="blue">EORTC_1</font> <font color="blue">QOL-30_1</font> <font color="blue">questionnaire_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> For the topotecan group , <font color="blue">median_1</font> <font color="blue">time_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">progression_1</font> was 18.9 weeks ( range < 1 to 92.6 + weeks ; 25% censored ) , and , for paclitaxel , 14.7 weeks ( range < 1 to 137.3 + weeks ; 12.3% censored ) ; P = 0.076 . At 4 years post - randomisation , <font color="blue">median_3</font> <font color="blue">survival_3</font> in the topotecan group was 63.0 weeks ( range < 1 to 238.4 + weeks ; 20.5% censored ) and , for paclitaxel , 53.0 weeks ( range < 1 to 226.3 + weeks ; 12.3% censored ) ; P = 0.44 . 
<br> CONCLUSION Topotecan continues to demonstrate <font color="blue">comparable_1</font> <font color="blue">efficacy_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">survival_1</font> to paclitaxel with manageable and non - cumulative haematological toxicity . <font color="blue">Non_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">haematological_1</font> <font color="blue">toxicity_1</font> was generally mild for both groups . The long - term survival rate indicates <font color="blue">substantial_1</font> <font color="blue">therapeutic_1</font> <font color="blue">benefit_1</font> for this group of patients receiving topotecan at relapse of ovarian cancer .
