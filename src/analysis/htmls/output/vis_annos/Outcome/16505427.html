Phase III study of two different dosing schedules of erythropoietin in anemic patients with cancer . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare maintenance epoetin alfa administered once every 3 weeks with continued weekly epoetin alfa for patients with cancer - associated anemia . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously ( SC ) , followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa ( 40 K arm ) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa ( 120 K arm ) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks . 
<br> RESULTS Three hundred sixty - five patients were enrolled . One hundred eighty - three patients were assigned to the 40 K arm , and 182 were assigned to the 120 K arm . There was no difference in the <font color="blue">proportion_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">patients_2</font> <font color="blue">requiring_2</font> <font color="blue">transfusions_2</font> during the study ( 23% in 40 K arm and 18% in 120 K arm , P = .22 ) or specifically during the maintenance phase ( 13% in 40 K arm v 15% in 120 K arm , P = .58 ) . Patients randomly assigned to the 40 K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g / dL <font color="blue">hemoglobin_2</font> <font color="blue">(_2</font> <font color="blue">Hb_2</font> <font color="blue">)_2</font> <font color="blue">increment_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> were more likely to have a <font color="blue">drug_1</font> <font color="blue">dose_1</font> <font color="blue">held_1</font> because of <font color="blue">high_3</font> <font color="blue">Hb_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> and had higher <font color="blue">mean_2</font> <font color="blue">end_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">study_3</font> <font color="blue">Hb_3</font> <font color="blue">levels_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> <font color="blue">Toxicities_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">including_1</font> <font color="blue">thromboembolism_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">overall_4</font> <font color="blue">survival_4</font> were <font color="blue">similar_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Patients in the 40 K arm had a <font color="blue">higher_1</font> <font color="blue">global_3</font> <font color="blue">quality_4</font> <font color="blue">of_4</font> <font color="blue">life_4</font> <font color="blue">(_4</font> <font color="blue">QOL_4</font> <font color="blue">)_4</font> at baseline for unclear reasons , whereas patients in the 120 K arm had a <font color="blue">greater_1</font> <font color="blue">global_3</font> <font color="blue">QOL_4</font> <font color="blue">improvement_4</font> during the study , so <font color="blue">end_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">study_2</font> <font color="blue">QOL_2</font> was equivalent . 
<br> CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U , a dose of 120,000 U can be administered <font color="blue">safely_1</font> once every 3 weeks without increasing <font color="blue">transfusion_1</font> <font color="blue">needs_1</font> or sacrificing <font color="blue">QOL_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> The <font color="blue">Hb_2</font> <font color="blue">increment_2</font> is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa . Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results .
