A randomized controlled study of a social skills training for preadolescent children with autism spectrum disorders : generalization of skills by training parents and teachers ? 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Social skills training ( SST ) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) to improve their <font color="blue">social_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">communication_1</font> <font color="blue">skills_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice , the evidence for the <font color="blue">effectiveness_1</font> of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive . Moreover , <font color="blue">long_1</font> <font color="blue">term_1</font> <font color="blue">outcome_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">generalization_1</font> of learned skills are little evaluated . Additionally , there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life . We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life . 
<br> METHOD / DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with three conditions , 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school ( 10 - 12 years of calendar age ) have been randomized to SST , SST - PTI ( SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement ) , or care - as - usual . The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children . In the SST - PTI condition , parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments . Assessment takes place at three moments : before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow - up . <font color="blue">Primary_1</font> <font color="blue">outcome_1</font> <font color="blue">is_1</font> <font color="blue">socialization_6</font> <font color="blue">,_6</font> <font color="blue">as_2</font> <font color="blue">an_2</font> <font color="blue">aspect_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">adaptive_2</font> <font color="blue">functioning_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> <font color="blue">Secondary_1</font> <font color="blue">outcomes_1</font> <font color="blue">focus_2</font> <font color="blue">on_2</font> <font color="blue">specific_5</font> <font color="blue">social_6</font> <font color="blue">skills_6</font> <font color="blue">children_5</font> <font color="blue">learn_5</font> <font color="blue">during_5</font> <font color="blue">SST_5</font> <font color="blue">and_5</font> <font color="blue">on_5</font> <font color="blue">more_5</font> <font color="blue">general_6</font> <font color="blue">social_6</font> <font color="blue">skills_6</font> <font color="blue">pertaining_6</font> <font color="blue">to_6</font> <font color="blue">home_6</font> <font color="blue">and_6</font> <font color="blue">community_6</font> <font color="blue">settings_6</font> <font color="blue">from_4</font> <font color="blue">a_4</font> <font color="blue">multi_4</font> <font color="blue">-_4</font> <font color="blue">informant_4</font> <font color="blue">perspective_4</font> <font color="blue">._4</font> <font color="blue">Additionally_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">possible_1</font> <font color="blue">predictors_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">outcome_1</font> <font color="blue">will_1</font> <font color="blue">be_1</font> <font color="blue">assessed_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> <font color="blue">
<br>_1</font> DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range ( 10 - 12 years ) . Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol , application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments , use of multiple raters , investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life , and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow - up measures at 6 months after the end of training .
