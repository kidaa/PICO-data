<br> This study examined the <font color="blue">efficacy_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">safety_2</font> of nifedipine sustained release ( nifedipine SR ) compared with Ginkgo biloba extract as treatment for primary Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) in Korea . Primary RP were screened and assigned to either the nifedipine SR group ( Group N ) or the Ginkgo biloba extract group ( Group G ) in the ratio of 2:1 . After a run - in period of 2 weeks , patients received treatment for 8 weeks . We observed the <font color="blue">percent_1</font> <font color="blue">improvement_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">the_2</font> <font color="blue">RP_6</font> <font color="blue">attack_6</font> <font color="blue">rate_5</font> between before and after the 8-week treatment . Ninety - three subjects were randomly assigned . The percent improvement in Group N was 50.1% at 8 weeks after treatment , while it was 31.0% in Group G ( p = 0.03 ) . <font color="blue">No_2</font> <font color="blue">serious_6</font> <font color="blue">adverse_6</font> <font color="blue">events_6</font> <font color="blue">occurred_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and <font color="blue">almost_2</font> <font color="blue">adverse_3</font> <font color="blue">events_3</font> <font color="blue">were_3</font> <font color="blue">mild_3</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">improved_2</font> <font color="blue">without_1</font> <font color="blue">specific_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> nifedipine SR was more <font color="blue">effective_2</font> than Ginkgo biloba extract for treatment of primary RP in Korean patients .
