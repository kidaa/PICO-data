Rationale and design of RE - LY : randomized evaluation of <font color="blue">long_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">term_1</font> <font color="blue">anticoagulant_1</font> <font color="blue">therapy_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> warfarin , compared with dabigatran . 
<br>
<br> Vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs ) are effective for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) but are difficult to use . Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran . It is administered in a fixed dose without laboratory monitoring and is being compared with warfarin ( international normalized ratio 2 - 3 ) in the RE - LY trial . Two doses of dabigatran ( 110 and 150 mg BID ) are being evaluated . RE - LY is a phase 3 , prospective , randomized , open - label multinational ( 44 countries ) trial of patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 risk factor for stroke . Recruitment concluded with a total of 18,113 patients . Patients who were VKA - naive and experienced are included in balanced proportions . The primary outcome is <font color="blue">stroke_1</font> ( including hemorrhagic ) or <font color="blue">systemic_2</font> <font color="blue">embolism_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Safety outcomes are <font color="blue">bleeding_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">liver_4</font> <font color="blue">function_4</font> <font color="blue">abnormalities_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">other_3</font> <font color="blue">adverse_3</font> <font color="blue">events_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> Adjudication of end points is blinded to drug assignment . The trial is expected to accrue a minimum of 450 events with a minimum 1-year of follow - up . RE - LY is the largest <font color="blue">AF_1</font> <font color="blue">stroke_1</font> <font color="blue">prevention_1</font> trial yet undertaken . It is unique because it includes equal numbers of VKA - experienced and naive patients and evaluates 2 different dosages of dabigatran , which may allow tailoring of dosing to individual patient needs . The worldwide site distribution and broad range of stroke risk further increase the general applicability of the trial . Results are expected in 2009 .
