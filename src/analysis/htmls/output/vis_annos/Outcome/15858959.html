<font color="blue">Effects_1</font> of Saccharomyces boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea . 
<br>
<br> AIM Certain probiotic agents , e.g. Lactobacillus GG , have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea , but few studies have examined the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii . We evaluated the effect of S. boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea . 
<br> METHODS Two hundred children were randomized to receive S. boulardii in a granulated form in a daily dose of 250 mg ( S. boulardii group ) or placebo ( placebo group ) for 5 d. Clinical and demographic characteristics on admission were similar between the study groups . 
<br> RESULTS <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">medians_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">average_2</font> <font color="blue">stool_2</font> <font color="blue">frequency_2</font> after the second day of the treatment were significantly lower in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group ( p = 0.003 ) . The <font color="blue">duration_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">diarrhoea_2</font> significantly reduced in the S. boulardii group compared with the placebo group ( 4.7 vs 5.5 d , p = 0.03 ) .

<br>_2</font> CONCLUSION The placebo - controlled study suggested that S. boulardii significantly reduced the <font color="blue">duration_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">acute_1</font> <font color="blue">diarrhoea_1</font> and the <font color="blue">duration_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">hospital_1</font> <font color="blue">stay_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> S. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically .
