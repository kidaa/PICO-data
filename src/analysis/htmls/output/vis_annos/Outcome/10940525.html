<br>
<br> A series of randomized , controlled , masked field studies was conducted to assess the <font color="blue">efficacy_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">safety_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">selamectin_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">flea_1</font> <font color="blue">infestations_1</font> on dogs and cats , and in the <font color="blue">prevention_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">heartworm_1</font> <font color="blue">infection_1</font> in dogs . In addition , observations were made on the <font color="blue">beneficial_1</font> <font color="blue">effect_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">selamectin_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> on dogs and cats showing signs of flea allergy dermatitis ( FAD ) . In all studies selamectin was applied topically , once per month , in unit doses providing a minimum dosage of 6mgkg(-1 ) . Dogs and cats with naturally occurring flea infestations , some of which also had signs associated with FAD , were assigned randomly to receive three months of topical treatment with selamectin ( 220 dogs , 189 cats ) or a positive - control product ( dogs : fenthion , n=81 ; cats : pyrethrins , n=66 ) . Selamectin was administered on days 0 , 30 , and 60 . Day 0 was defined as the day that the animal first received treatment . <font color="blue">Flea_2</font> <font color="blue">burdens_2</font> were assessed by <font color="blue">flea_1</font> <font color="blue">comb_1</font> <font color="blue">counts_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">clinical_1</font> <font color="blue">evaluations_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">FAD_1</font> were performed before treatment , and on days 14 , 30 , 60 , and 90 .

A total of 397 dogs free of adult heartworm infection from four heartworm - endemic areas of the USA were allocated randomly to six months of treatment with selamectin ( n=298 ) or ivermectin ( n=99 ) . Selamectin achieved a <font color="blue">heartworm_2</font> <font color="blue">prevention_2</font> <font color="blue">rate_2</font> of 100% , with all dogs testing negative for microfilariae and adult heartworm antigen on days 180 and 300 . Selamectin was administered to a total of 673 dogs and 347 cats having an age range of 6 weeks to 19 years ( 3954 doses ) . The animals included 19 purebred or crossbred Collies ( Bearded , Border , and unspecified ) .
