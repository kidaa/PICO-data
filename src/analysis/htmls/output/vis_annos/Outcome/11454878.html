Recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma : a randomized phase III study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus topotecan . 
<br>
<br> PURPOSE To compare the <font color="blue">efficacy_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">safety_1</font> of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) and topotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or did n't respond to first - line , platinum - based chemotherapy . 
<br> PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with <font color="blue">measurable_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">assessable_1</font> disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg / m(2 ) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg / m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks . Patients were stratified prospectively for <font color="blue">platinum_1</font> <font color="blue">sensitivity_1</font> and for the presence or absence of <font color="blue">bulky_1</font> <font color="blue">disease_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated ( 239 PLD and 235 topotecan ) . They comprised the intent - to - treat population . The <font color="blue">overall_2</font> <font color="blue">progression_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">free_2</font> <font color="blue">survival_2</font> <font color="blue">rates_2</font> were similar between the two arms ( P = .095 ) . The <font color="blue">overall_2</font> <font color="blue">response_2</font> <font color="blue">rates_2</font> for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0% , respectively ( P = .390 ) . <font color="blue">Median_1</font> <font color="blue">overall_2</font> <font color="blue">survival_2</font> <font color="blue">times_2</font> were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan . Data analyzed in platinum - sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically <font color="blue">significant_1</font> <font color="blue">benefit_1</font> <font color="blue">from_1</font> <font color="blue">PLD_1</font> <font color="blue">for_1</font> <font color="blue">progression_2</font> <font color="blue">-_2</font> <font color="blue">free_2</font> <font color="blue">survival_2</font> ( P = .037 ) , with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan . For <font color="blue">overall_1</font> <font color="blue">survival_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> PLD was significantly superior to topotecan ( P = .008 ) , with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks . The platinum - refractory subgroup demonstrated a <font color="blue">nonstatistically_1</font> <font color="blue">significant_1</font> <font color="blue">survival_1</font> <font color="blue">trend_1</font> in favor of topotecan ( P = .455 ) . <font color="blue">Severe_1</font> <font color="blue">hematologic_1</font> <font color="blue">toxicity_1</font> was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with <font color="blue">dosage_1</font> <font color="blue">modification_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">growth_1</font> <font color="blue">factor_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">blood_1</font> <font color="blue">product_1</font> <font color="blue">utilization_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSION The <font color="blue">comparable_1</font> <font color="blue">efficacy_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">favorable_1</font> <font color="blue">safety_1</font> <font color="blue">profile_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">convenient_1</font> <font color="blue">dosing_1</font> <font color="blue">support_1</font> the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population .
