Necessary but not sufficient : the effect of screening and feedback on outcomes of primary care patients with untreated <font color="blue">anxiety_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE To consider the impact on primary care patient outcomes of using both a screener to determine <font color="blue">elevated_1</font> <font color="blue">anxiety_1</font> <font color="blue">levels_1</font> among patients with previously undetected anxiety and a physician intervention to inform physicians of their patients ' conditions . 
<br> DESIGN Participating physicians were randomized to either the demonstration or the control arm , and patients were assigned to a study arm based on the randomization of their physicians . The patients were followed for change in outcome measures during the five - month study period . 
<br> SETTING A mixed - model health maintenance organization serving approximately 110,000 enrollees in central Colorado . 
<br> PATIENTS / PARTICIPANTS 573 patients who had <font color="blue">unrecognized_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">untreated_1</font> <font color="blue">anxiety_1</font> identified from the approximately 8,000 patients who completed the waiting room screening questionnaire . 
<br> INTERVENTIONS A physician intervention served the dual function of 1 ) providing an educational demonstration of anxiety in the primary care setting and 2 ) providing a reporting system for summarizing the anxiety symptom levels and functioning status of the patients enrolled in the study . 
<br> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient outcomes were measured as <font color="blue">changes_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">global_3</font> <font color="blue">anxiety_3</font> <font color="blue">scores_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">functioning_3</font> <font color="blue">and_3</font> <font color="blue">well_3</font> <font color="blue">-_3</font> <font color="blue">being_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">and_3</font> <font color="blue">patients_3</font> <font color="blue">'_3</font> <font color="blue">reports_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">global_3</font> <font color="blue">improvements_3</font> <font color="blue">._3</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that this method of reporting symptoms and functioning status to primary care physicians did not significantly change patient outcomes . Improvement in outcomes appeared to be more closely associated with the <font color="blue">patient_1</font> <font color="blue">'s_1</font> <font color="blue">severity_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">psychological_1</font> <font color="blue">distress_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font>
