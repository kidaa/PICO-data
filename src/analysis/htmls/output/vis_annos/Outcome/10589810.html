Clinical effects of root instrumentation using conventional steel or non - tooth substance removing plastic curettes during supportive periodontal therapy ( SPT ) . 
<br>
<br> Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause - related treatment of periodontal diseases , repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in <font color="blue">substantive_1</font> <font color="blue">loss_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">tooth_1</font> <font color="blue">substance_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">increased_1</font> <font color="blue">sensitivity_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">teeth_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy , non - root substance removing curettes have been developed . However , the clinical effects of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established . The aims of this study were , therefore , to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic curettes ( Universal Perio Soft Scaler , Hawe - Neos Dental , Bioggio , TI , Switzerland ) versus conventional steel curettes on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy . 40 subjects participated in this parallel , randomized , double blind , prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy . 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel curettes during a supportive periodontal care visit ( SPT ) . The other 20 subjects , the experimental group , were treated using plastic curettes during a similar SPT visit . Clinical parameters , such as <font color="blue">bleeding_3</font> <font color="blue">on_3</font> <font color="blue">probing_3</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">BOP_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">probing_3</font> <font color="blue">pocket_3</font> <font color="blue">depth_3</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">PPD_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> were assessed at baseline and 3 - 6 months later at the next regular SPT visit . In addition , <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">BOP_3</font> <font color="blue">percentage_3</font> was determined 10 days following baseline . The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding <font color="blue">BOP_3</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">PPD_3</font> at any observation time . Both treatments were effective in reducing the <font color="blue">BOP_4</font> <font color="blue">percentage_4</font> which ranged from 17 - 42% at baseline by about 40% after 10 days ( <font color="blue">mean_1</font> <font color="blue">BOP_1</font> <font color="blue">baseline_1</font> <font color="blue">:_1</font> 26% , mean BOP after 10 days : 16% ) . This clinical study suggests that non - root substance removing curettes may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care , thus minimizing <font color="blue">trauma_1</font> on the hard structures of the teeth .
