Raising high - density lipoprotein in humans through inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein : an initial multidose study of torcetrapib . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE The ability of the potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) inhibitor torcetrapib ( CP-529,414 ) to raise high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) levels in healthy young subjects was <font color="blue">tested_1</font> in this initial phase 1 multidose study . 
<br> METHODS AND RESULTS Five groups of 8 subjects each were randomized to placebo ( n=2 ) or torcetrapib ( n=6 ) at 10 , 30 , 60 , and 120 mg daily and 120 mg twice daily for 14 days . Torcetrapib was well <font color="blue">tolerated_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> with all treated subjects completing the study . The <font color="blue">correlation_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">plasma_2</font> <font color="blue">drug_2</font> <font color="blue">levels_2</font> <font color="blue">with_1</font> <font color="blue">inhibition_1</font> ( EC50=43 nM ) was as expected based on in vitro potency ( IC50 approximately 50 nM ) , and <font color="blue">increases_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">CETP_2</font> <font color="blue">mass_2</font> were consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition . <font color="blue">CETP_2</font> <font color="blue">inhibition_2</font> increased with escalating dose , leading to elevations of HDL - C of 16% to 91% . <font color="blue">Total_2</font> <font color="blue">plasma_2</font> <font color="blue">cholesterol_2</font> did not change significantly because of a reduction in <font color="blue">nonHDL_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">C_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> including a 21% to 42% lowering of <font color="blue">low_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">density_1</font> <font color="blue">lipoprotein_1</font> <font color="blue">cholesterol_1</font> at the higher doses . <font color="blue">Apolipoprotein_1</font> <font color="blue">A_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">I_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">E_1</font> were elevated 27% and 66% , respectively , and <font color="blue">apoB_1</font> was reduced 26% with 120 mg twice daily . <font color="blue">Cholesteryl_1</font> <font color="blue">ester_1</font> <font color="blue">content_1</font> decreased and triglyceride increased in the nonHDL plasma fraction , with contrasting changes occurring in HDL . 
<br> CONCLUSIONS These effects of <font color="blue">CETP_1</font> <font color="blue">inhibition_1</font> resemble those observed in partial CETP deficiency . This work serves as a prelude to further studies in subjects with low HDL , or combinations of dyslipidemia , in assessing the role of CETP in atherosclerosis .
