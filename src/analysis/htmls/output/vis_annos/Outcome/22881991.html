Teaching <font color="blue">emotion_1</font> <font color="blue">recognition_1</font> <font color="blue">skills_1</font> to young children with autism : a randomised controlled trial of an emotion training programme . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND Children with autism have difficulties in emotion recognition and a number of interventions have been designed to target these problems . However , few emotion training interventions have been trialled with young children with autism and co - morbid ID . This study aimed to evaluate the <font color="blue">efficacy_3</font> of an emotion training programme for a group of young children with autism with a range of intellectual ability . 
<br> METHODS Participants were 55 children with autistic disorder , aged 4 - 7 years ( FSIQ 42 - 107 ) . Children were randomly assigned to an intervention ( n = 28 ) or control group ( n = 27 ) . Participants in the intervention group watched a DVD designed to teach emotion recognition skills to children with autism ( the Transporters ) , whereas the control group watched a DVD of Thomas the Tank Engine . Participants were assessed on their <font color="blue">ability_2</font> <font color="blue">to_2</font> <font color="blue">complete_2</font> <font color="blue">basic_3</font> <font color="blue">emotion_3</font> <font color="blue">recognition_3</font> <font color="blue">tasks_3</font> <font color="blue">,_3</font> <font color="blue">mindreading_3</font> <font color="blue">and_3</font> <font color="blue">theory_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">mind_3</font> <font color="blue">(_3</font> <font color="blue">TOM_3</font> <font color="blue">)_3</font> <font color="blue">tasks_3</font> <font color="blue">before_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">after_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">4-week_1</font> <font color="blue">intervention_1</font> <font color="blue">period_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> and at 3-month follow - up . 
<br> RESULTS Analyses controlled for the effect of <font color="blue">chronological_1</font> <font color="blue">age_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">verbal_1</font> <font color="blue">intelligence_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">gender_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">DVD_1</font> <font color="blue">viewing_1</font> <font color="blue">time_1</font> <font color="blue">on_1</font> <font color="blue">outcomes_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Children in the intervention group showed improved <font color="blue">performance_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">recognition_4</font> <font color="blue">of_4</font> <font color="blue">anger_4</font> compared with the control group , with few improvements maintained at 3-month follow - up . There was no generalisation of <font color="blue">skills_1</font> <font color="blue">to_1</font> <font color="blue">TOM_2</font> <font color="blue">or_2</font> <font color="blue">social_2</font> <font color="blue">skills_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS The Transporters programme showed limited <font color="blue">efficacy_1</font> in <font color="blue">teaching_1</font> <font color="blue">basic_1</font> <font color="blue">emotion_1</font> <font color="blue">recognition_1</font> <font color="blue">skills_1</font> to young children with autism with a lower range of <font color="blue">cognitive_1</font> <font color="blue">ability_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> Improvements were limited to the recognition of expressions of anger , with poor maintenance of these skills at follow - up . These findings provide limited support for the efficacy of the Transporters programme for young children with autism of a lower cognitive range .
