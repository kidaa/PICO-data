Children responded to measures of attitudes ( <font color="blue">Adjective_1</font> <font color="blue">Checklist_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> and behavioral intentions ( <font color="blue">Shared_1</font> <font color="blue">Activities_1</font> <font color="blue">Questionnaire_1</font> <font color="blue">)_1</font> . Children rated the typical boy more favorably than the boy showing autistic symptoms . When compared to descriptive information alone , the combination of descriptive and explanatory information resulted in improved third- and fourth - graders ' but not fifth - graders ' attitudes toward the child with autism .
