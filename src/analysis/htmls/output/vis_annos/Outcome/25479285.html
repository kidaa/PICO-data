Randomised trial of text messaging on adherence to cardiovascular preventive treatment ( INTERACT trial ) . 
<br>
<br> BACKGROUND About one third of patients prescribed blood pressure or lipid - lowering drugs for the prevention of <font color="blue">coronary_1</font> <font color="blue">heart_1</font> <font color="blue">disease_1</font> <font color="blue">and_1</font> <font color="blue">stroke_1</font> do not take their medication as prescribed . We conducted a randomized trial to <font color="blue">evaluate_1</font> text messaging as a means of improving adherence to cardiovascular disease preventive treatment . 
<br> METHODS 303 patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid - lowering medications were randomly assigned to being sent text messages ( Text group , 151 ) or not being sent them ( No text group , 152 ) . Texts were sent daily for 2 weeks , alternate days for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter for 22 weeks ( 6 months overall ) , using an automated computer programme . Patients were asked to respond on whether they had taken their medication , whether the text reminded them to do so if they had forgotten , and if they had not taken their medication to determine if there was a reason for not doing so . At 6 months , <font color="blue">use_1</font> <font color="blue">of_1</font> <font color="blue">medication_1</font> <font color="blue">was_1</font> <font color="blue">assessed_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> <font color="blue">
<br>_1</font> RESULTS Two patients were lost to follow - up , providing data on 301 for analysis . In the No text group 38/151 ( 25% ) took less than 80% of the <font color="blue">prescribed_1</font> <font color="blue">regimen_1</font> ( ie . stopped medication completely or took it on fewer than 22 of the last 28 days of follow - up ) compared to 14/150 patients ( 9% ) in the Text group - an improvement in <font color="blue">adherence_2</font> affecting 16 per 100 patients ( 95% CI 7 to 24 ) , p<0.001 . The texts reminded 98/151 patients ( 65% ) to take medication on at least one occasion and lead to 20/151 ( 13% ) who stopped taking medication because of concern over <font color="blue">efficacy_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">side_1</font> <font color="blue">-_1</font> <font color="blue">effects_1</font> <font color="blue">,_1</font> <font color="blue">resuming_1</font> <font color="blue">treatment_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> 
<br> CONCLUSIONS In patients taking blood pressure or lipid - lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , <font color="blue">text_1</font> <font color="blue">messaging_1</font> <font color="blue">improved_1</font> <font color="blue">medication_1</font> adherence compared with no text messaging .
