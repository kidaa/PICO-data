In school - aged children a combination of galacto - oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus GG increases <font color="blue">bifidobacteria_1</font> more than Lactobacillus GG on its own . 
<br>
<br> The aim of this study was to compare a combination of Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) and galacto - oligosaccharides ( GOS ) with LGG on its own , and their effects on the <font color="blue">intestinal_1</font> <font color="blue">microbiota_1</font> in school - aged children . The randomized , double - blinded , crossover study comprised 30 healthy children . There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash - out period in between . The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk - based fruit juice containing either LGG alone ( 6.5 x 10(9 ) CFU ) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS . Symptom diaries were filled during the study periods . <font color="blue">Fecal_1</font> <font color="blue">samples_1</font> were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods . At the end of both study periods , the <font color="blue">amount_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">bifidobacteria_3</font> was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone ( geometric mean 9.33 x 10(9 ) vs. 4.28 x 10(9 ) CFU / g , p < 0.001 ) . No significant differences were seen in the <font color="blue">amount_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">lactobacilli_4</font> <font color="blue">or_4</font> <font color="blue">LGG_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> nor did <font color="blue">gastrointestinal_4</font> <font color="blue">symptoms_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">defecation_4</font> <font color="blue">frequency_4</font> <font color="blue">,_4</font> <font color="blue">consistency_4</font> <font color="blue">of_4</font> <font color="blue">stools_4</font> <font color="blue">or_4</font> <font color="blue">ease_4</font> <font color="blue">of_4</font> <font color="blue">defecation_4</font> differ between the two study periods . Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the <font color="blue">bifidobacteria_3</font> more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a <font color="blue">prebiotic_1</font> <font color="blue">effect_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> children . The children tolerated well a daily intake of 2 g of GOS .
