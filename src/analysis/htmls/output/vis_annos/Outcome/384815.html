<br> Three hundred forty - one Tanzanian preschool children were randomly assigned to levamisole or placebo treatment given at three - month intervals . <font color="blue">Weights_4</font> <font color="blue">and_4</font> <font color="blue">heights_4</font> were measured at the tri - monthly treatment visits for a period of one year . Among the 273 children who were seen and weighed at the one - year follow - up visit , <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">rate_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">weight_3</font> <font color="blue">gain_3</font> was 8 per cent greater for those receiving levamisole than for placebo - treated controls ( p = .06 ) . In 78 children known to be infected with Ascaris at baseline , <font color="blue">the_1</font> <font color="blue">rate_3</font> <font color="blue">of_3</font> <font color="blue">weight_5</font> <font color="blue">gain_5</font> was 21 per cent greater in children treated with levamisole than in those receiving placebo ( p = .03 ) . <font color="blue">The_1</font> <font color="blue">rate_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">height_4</font> <font color="blue">gain_4</font> was no different for treatment and placebo groups .
