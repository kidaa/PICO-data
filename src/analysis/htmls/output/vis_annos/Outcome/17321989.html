The prophylactic effect of itraconazole capsules and fluconazole capsules for <font color="blue">systemic_2</font> <font color="blue">fungal_2</font> <font color="blue">infections_2</font> in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes : a Japanese multicenter randomized , controlled study . 
<br>
<br> We performed a randomized , controlled study comparing the prophylactic effects of capsule forms of fluconazole ( n = 110 ) and itraconazole ( n = 108 ) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) during and after chemotherapy . There were 4 cases with possible <font color="blue">systemic_2</font> <font color="blue">fungal_2</font> <font color="blue">infection_2</font> in the itraconazole group , and there were 8 possible and 3 probable cases in the fluconazole group . Adverse events did not significantly differ in the 2 groups . In patients with MDS or in the remission - induction phase of chemotherapy , the numbers of cases with <font color="blue">probable_1</font> <font color="blue">or_1</font> <font color="blue">possible_1</font> <font color="blue">infections_1</font> were lower in the itraconazole group than in the fluconazole group , whereas no difference was seen in patients with AML or in the consolidation phase of therapy . In patients with <font color="blue">neutrophil_1</font> <font color="blue">counts_1</font> of > 0.1 x 10(9)/L lasting for more than 4 weeks , the <font color="blue">frequency_2</font> <font color="blue">of_2</font> <font color="blue">infection_2</font> in the fluconazole group ( 5 of 9 patients ) was significantly higher than in the itraconazole group ( 0 of 7 patients ; P = .03 ) . Our results suggest that both drugs were <font color="blue">well_1</font> <font color="blue">tolerated_1</font> in patients with AML or MDS who received chemotherapy and that the efficacy of itraconazole for prophylaxis against <font color="blue">systemic_1</font> <font color="blue">fungal_1</font> <font color="blue">disease_1</font> is not inferior to that of fluconazole .
