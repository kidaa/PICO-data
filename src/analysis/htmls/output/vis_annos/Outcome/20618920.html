<br>
<br> BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure , physical activity , sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of depression . However , to our knowledge , there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy . 
<br> METHODS Multicenter , randomized , controlled , two arm - parallel , clinical trial . Eighty depressed patients undergoing standard antidepressant treatment will be advised to follow four additional hygienic - dietary recommendations about <font color="blue">exercise_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">diet_2</font> <font color="blue">,_2</font> <font color="blue">sunlight_2</font> <font color="blue">exposure_2</font> <font color="blue">and_2</font> <font color="blue">sleep_2</font> <font color="blue">._2</font> Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the 6 month intervention period . 
<br> DISCUSSION We expect the patients in the active recommendations group to experience a <font color="blue">greater_1</font> <font color="blue">improvement_1</font> <font color="blue">in_1</font> <font color="blue">their_1</font> <font color="blue">depressive_1</font> <font color="blue">symptoms_1</font> <font color="blue">._1</font> If so , this would be a great support for doctors who might systematically recommend these simple and costless measures , especially in primary care .
