In light of the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on TSH secretion , we examined whether this condition is caused by an increased hypothalamic somatostatinergic tone in starving subjects . The possible involvement of endogenous opioids in the mechanism underlying the abnormal TSH response to TRH was also evaluated . \n METHODS The TSH response to TRH ( 25 micrograms in an intravenous bolus ) , serum total and free T4 and T3 levels , and 24-hour urinary - free cortisol levels were measured in 28 normal men ( age 27 - 35 years ) within 10 % of their ideal body weight . They were randomly divided into 4 groups of 7 . In 21 subjects ( groups 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , TRH tests were performed after an overnight ( 8 hours ) fast , placebo administrations ( control test ) , and after prolonged ( 56 hours ) starvation . TRH tests after prolonged starvation were performed either after placebos ( in all subjects ) or the administration of pyridostigmine ( 180 mg orally ) ( in 7 subjects , group 1 ) ; naloxone ( 0.8 mg in an i.v . bolus injection ) ( in 7 subjects , group 2 ) ; or the combination of pyridostigmine and naloxone ( in 7 subjects , group 3 ) . The remaining 7 subjects ( group 4 ) were tested at weekly intervals with TRH plus placebo , TRH plus naloxone , TRH plus pyridostigmine , and TRH plus naloxone plus pyridostigmine after a fasting period of 8 hours . \n RESULTS In all subjects of groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , TRH - induced TSH rise was significantly lower after prolonged starvation than after overnight fast . Neither pyridostigmine nor naloxone , given alone , changed the basal levels of TSH and the TSH response to TRH after prolonged starvation . In contrast , the concomitant administration of naloxone and pyridostigmine significantly enhanced the TRH - induced TSH rise . After overnight fasting , naloxone administration in group 4 subjects did not change the TSH response to TRH , whereas pyridostigmine significantly enhanced the TSH response to TRH. When naloxone was given together with pyridostigmine and TRH the TSH response was similar to that observed in the TRH plus pyridostigmine test . \n CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that naloxone - sensitive endogenous opioids exert an inhibitory effect on the cholinergic stimulatory control of TSH secretion during prolonged starvation .

By a double - blind , placebo - controlled , balanced randomization , subjects received GM - CSF priming on days 5 to 1 for courses 1 and 3 or courses 2 and 4 . \n RESULTS Compared with before priming , after priming the times to neutrophil nadir ( 12.8 +/- 2.5 days v 14.8 +/- 1.5 days , respectively ; P =.0001 ) and platelet nadir ( mean +/- SD , 10.1 +/- 1.9 days v 11.1 +/- 2.2 days , P < .05 ) were shorter , indicating a shift of cytotoxicity to later progenitors . The neutrophil nadir was similar with and without priming ( mean +/- SD , 490 +/- 310/microL v 550 +/- 350/microL , respectively ; P =.2 ) ; however , on day 16 the mean neutrophil count was higher ( mean +/- SD , 1030 +/- 580/microL v 690 +/- 370/microL , P =.004 ) , and the proportion of patients with a neutrophil count less than 500/microL was lower after priming than before ( six of 35 or 17 . 1 % v 12 of 34 or 35.3 % , respectively ; P =.04 ) .

Children who met specified minimum criteria regarding the persistence of MEE became eligible for a clinical trial in which they were assigned randomly to undergo tympanostomy tube placement either promptly or after a defined extended period if MEE remained present . From among those remaining , we selected randomly , within sociodemographic strata , a sample of 241 children who represented a spectrum of MEE experience from having no MEE to having MEE whose cumulative duration fell just short of meeting randomization criteria .

In these 241 children we assessed language development , speech sound production , and cognition at 3 years of age , using both formal tests and conversational samples . \n RESULTS We found weak to moderate , statistically significant negative correlations between children 's cumulative durations of MEE in their first year of life or in age periods that included their first year of life , and their scores on formal tests of receptive vocabulary and verbal aspects of cognition at 3 years of age . However , the percent of variance in these scores explained by time with MEE in the first year of life beyond that explained by sociodemographic variables ranged only from 1.2 % to 2.9 % , and the negative correlations were concentrated in the subgroup of children whose families had private health insurance ( rather than Medicaid ) .

The major causes of poor nutritional status are related to the underlying disease , socio - economic factors , age , and length of hospitalization .

It is of utmost importance to identify patients at risk for malnutrition in order to prevent related complications . \n METHODS The 374 patients evaluated in this study were a subgroup of a larger multicenter , cross - sectional , randomized study that was carried out in 1996 . Nutritional status was assessed by using Subjective Global Assessment . \n RESULTS Malnutrition was present in 55 % of the patients , with 19 % of the patients severely malnourished . The presence of cancer , infection , age over 60 years , upper gastrointestinal disease , and longer length of hospital stay all negatively influenced nutritional status . Despite the high prevalence of malnutrition , the medical teams only assessed the nutritional status of a few patients . \n CONCLUSION Malnutrition was highly prevalent in this setting of patients . Therefore , patients with the risk factors above presented should routinely undergo nutritional screening and/or assessment in order to be able to early diagnose or prevent malnutrition and its correlated morbidity and mortality .", "Participants_prec": 0.61187084520417856, "Outcome_recl": 0.5, "Participants_text": "Risk factors for malnutrition in patients undergoing gastroenterological and hernia surgery : an analysis of 374 patients . \n\n .

At follow - up , qDES showed reduced neointimal growth by 70 % at the tightest cross section and by 68 % over the stented segment ( P<0.0001 for both ) , resulting in a significantly larger lumen in qDES than in BMS. Unlike intracoronary brachytherapy , there was no evidence of negative edge effects , unhealed dissections , or late stent - vessel wall malapposition over the stented and adjacent references segments in either group . \n CONCLUSIONS Detailed IVUS analysis revealed that qDES had comparable acute mechanical and superior long - term biological effects to BMS. Although the long - term benefits and limitations of this technology require further investigation , the reduction in neointimal thickenings demonstrated that local delivery of 7-hexanoyltaxol through polymer sleeves augments conventional mechanical treatment of atherosclerotic disease .", "Participants_prec": 0.76875000000000004, "Outcome_recl": 0.57908730158730159, "Participants_text": "7-hexanoyltaxol - eluting stent for prevention of neointimal growth : an intravascular ultrasound analysis from the Study to COmpare REstenosis rate between QueST and QuaDS - QP2 ( SCORE ) . \n\n .

The estimates were further compared between the two groups irrespective of drug used to evaluate the difference , if any . \n METHODS The study was a double blind , uncontrolled , noncrossover and randomized trial . Fifty patients of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes were divided in to two groups . Group I ( 25 patients ) received capsule A ( glibenclamide ) while Group II ( 25 patients ) received capsule B ( gliclazide ) . The parameters studied were Superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , malonyl - dialdehyde ( MDA ) and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) . They were done at ( a ) uncontrolled stage ( FBS--165 +/- 16.7 mg/dl , PP--240 +/- 30.1 mg/dl and HbA1--10.5 +/- 0.9 % in group I and FBS--150 +/- 15.8 mg/dl , PP--246 +/- 29.1 mg/dl HbA1 10.6 +/- 0.8 % in group II ) and during controlled stage at 12 weeks ( FBS--120 +/- 18.5 mg/dl , PP--180 +/- 19.1 mg/dl and HbA1--8.4 +/- 0.29 % in group I and FBS--118 +/- 17.6 mg/dl , PP--176 +/- 20.1 mg/dl and HbA1--8.5 +/- 0.39 % in group II patients ) . \n RESULTS The significantly raised levels of MDA and SOD , and decreased levels of reduced glutathione ( GSH ) during uncontrolled stage of diabetes indicated free radical stress induced lipid peroxidation .

Postmenopausal women ( n = 1226 ) with two or more prevalent vertebral fractures received risedronate 2.5 or 5 mg/day or placebo ; all subjects also received elemental calcium 1000 mg/day , and up to 500 IU/day vitamin D if baseline levels were low . The study duration was 3 years ; however , the 2.5 mg group was discontinued by protocol amendment after 2 years . Lateral spinal radiographs were taken annually for assessment of vertebral fractures , and bone mineral density was measured by dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry at 6-month intervals . Risedronate 5 mg reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures by 49 % over 3 years compared with control ( p<0.001 ) . A significant reduction of 61 % was seen within the first year ( p = 0.001 ) . The fracture reduction with risedronate 2.5 mg was similar to that in the 5 mg group over 2 years . The risk of nonvertebral fractures was reduced by 33 % compared with control over 3 years ( p = 0.06 ) . Risedronate significantly increased bone mineral density at the spine and hip within 6 months . The adverse - event profile of risedronate , including gastrointestinal adverse events , was similar to that of control .

An important part of the mechanism of DVT prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) is reduced venous stasis with increased velocity of venous return . The conventional methods of IPC use low pressure and slow inflation of the air bladder on the leg to augment venous return . Recently , compression devices have been designed that produce high pressure and rapid inflation of air cuffs on the plantar plexus of the foot and the calf . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the venous velocity response to high - pressure , rapid - inflation compression devices versus standard , low - pressure , slow - inflation compression devices in healthy volunteers and patients with severe post - thrombotic venous disease . \n METHOD Twenty - two lower extremities from healthy volunteers and 11 lower extremities from patients with class 4 to class 6 post - thrombotic chronic venous insufficiency were studied . With duplex ultrasound scanning ( ATL - Ultramark 9 , Advanced Tech Laboratory , Bothell , Wash ) , acute DVT was excluded before subject evaluation . Venous velocities were monitored after the application of each of five IPC devices , with all the patients in the supine position . Three high - pressure , rapid - compression devices and two standard , low - pressure , slow - inflation compression devices were applied in a random sequence . Maximal venous velocities were obtained at the common femoral vein and the popliteal vein for all the devices and were recorded as the mean peak velocity of three compression cycles and compared with baseline velocities . \n RESULTS The baseline venous velocities were higher in the femoral veins than in the popliteal veins in both the volunteers and the post - thrombotic subjects . Standard and high - pressure , rapid - inflation compression significantly increased the popliteal and femoral vein velocities in healthy and post - thrombotic subjects . High - pressure , rapid - inflation compression produced significantly higher maximal venous velocities in the popliteal and femoral veins in both healthy volunteers and patients who were post - thrombotic as compared with standard compression . Compared with the healthy volunteers , the patients who were post - thrombotic had a significantly attenuated velocity response at both the popliteal and the femoral vein levels . \n CONCLUSION High - pressure , rapid - inflation pneumatic compression increases popliteal and femoral vein velocity as compared with standard , low - pressure , slow - inflation pneumatic compression .

Central nervous system function was assessed by use of the Auditory Steady State Response ( ASSR ) and Bispectral Index ( BIS ) analysis of electrooculogram . During continuous administration of propofol , reversal of unconsciousness produced by physostigmine ( 28 microgram/kg ) and block of this reversal by scopolamine ( 8.6 microgram/kg ) were evaluated . \n RESULTS Propofol produced unconsciousness at a plasma concentration of 3.2 +/- 0.8 ( +/- SD ) microgram/ml ( n = 17 ) .

A prospective randomized trial . \n\n PURPOSE Periprostatic local anesthesia for prostate biopsy requires 2 or more extra needle punctures and injection of the local anesthetic through the highly colonized rectum . To our knowledge we report the first prospective randomized trial to assess the infectious or hemorrhagic complications associated with this method . \n MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients with sterile urine cultures underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy . They were randomized to receive a periprostatic nerve block or no anesthesia . Patients were evaluated for the amount of rectal and urethral bleeding , and symptoms and signs of infection after biopsy . \n RESULTS The amount of urethral bleeding was slight and similar in the 2 groups . Rectal bleeding was significantly less in the patients who received anesthesia . High fever ( greater than 37.8C ) was more frequent in the nerve block group and 2 patients in this group required rehospitalization . Bacteriuria in post - biopsy urine cultures was significantly more common in the anesthesia group . \n CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that periprostatic local anesthesia for prostate biopsy does not increase the risk of urethral bleeding . It is associated with a decreased incidence of rectal bleeding , presumably due to decreased patient discomfort . The incidence of bacteriuria was significantly higher in the anesthesia group .

Thirteen age - matched healthy volunteers served as controls . Briefly , arginine ( 30 g ) was infused from -30 to 0 min , and GHRH ( 100 microg ) was injected as a bolus at 0 min , with measurement of serum GH [ immunoradiometric assay ( IRMA ) ] every 15 min for 150 min .

The study design included also an endocrine work - up aimed to study the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis [ urinary free cortisol ( UFC ) excretion , serum cortisol at 0800 h , plasma ACTH at 0800 h , morning cortisol after overnight 1 mg dexamethasone ] . Five of 10 patients showed abnormalities of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis , including borderline or increased UFC excretion in 4 of them accompanied by blunted ACTH in 2 cases and failure of cortisol to suppress after dexamethasone in 1 ; the fifth patient displayed low ACTH and resistance to dexamethasone suppression .

Receiver operator curves ( ROC ) were used to assess the value of the follow - up percent diameter stenosis ( DS ) for each of the three analyzed segments in predicting target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) . \n RESULTS ( 192)Ir reduced recurrent restenosis ( 23.7 % vs. 60.7 % , p < 0.001 ) and the length of recurrent restenosis ( 8.99 +/- 4.34 mm vs. 17.54 +/- 10.48 mm , p < 0.001 ) at follow - up compared to placebo . Isolated stent edge ( 3.4 % ) and ribbon edge ( 1.7 % ) restenoses were infrequent in both groups . The best angiographic surrogate of TVR was the 50 % follow - up DS obtained from the ribbon+margin analysis ( ROC area 0.806 ) . \n CONCLUSIONS In WRIST , not only was ( 192)Ir therapy effective in reducing restenosis , but it also reduced the lesion length of treatment failures by 50 % , and it was not associated with edge proliferation . The restenosis rate obtained from the vessel segment inclusive of the dose fall - off zones was the best correlate of TVR and should become a standard analysis site in all vascular brachytherapy trials . \n\n .", "Intervention_corr_gt": null, "Outcome_prec": 0.1873622782446312, "Intervention_corr": 0.4829303379150936, "Outcome_prec_gt": null, "Intervention_recl": 0.48674242424242425, "docid": "11788219", "Intervention_prec_gt": null, "Participants_corr_gt": null, "Intervention_prec": 0.44631834215167548, "Participants_corr": 0.39930977058807271, "Outcome_corr_gt": null, "Participants_recl_gt": null}

In the trial group , skin incision parallel to the thenar crease was made up to 2.5 cm in length , under an operating microscope and endoscopic transillumination . Skin incision in the control group began at the distal border of the carpal ligament , followed the longitudinal crease of the palm , and crossed the base of the palm in a zigzag fashion . Three months after surgery , the patients were asked about symptomatic relief and intervals between the operation and return to their daily activities and work , and examined for scar tenderness and esthetic outcome .

Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown . We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in 8 healthy volunteers , and 6 women with untreated primary hypothyroidism , a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin . The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide ( Sandostatin ; each injection 50 microg ) . During the nights when the healthy volunteers were given octreotide , melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline .

Based on a presentation by Sandra L. Tunis , PhD. \n\n With the advent of atypical agents in the treatment of schizophrenia , physicians and policy makers must consider the costs that may accompany greater clinical efficacy . Analyses reveal that olanzapine shows a greater clinical cost effectiveness , as well as a greater functional cost effectiveness , than haloperidol , and that functional outcomes , in particular , show promise as important measures of effectiveness . Functional outcomes can help differentiate medications and can be used to help demonstrate the cost effectiveness of atypical agents . Mental health and physical health functioning , as well as work status , are all measures of functioning that have been used to evaluate treatment strategies . When comparing olanzapine with haloperidol , cost savings are seen throughout the treatment period ( 1 year ) , with physical functioning most highly affected over time . Functional outcomes can therefore serve 2 purposes : to enhance compliance by improving health - related quality of life and to assist in making both treatment and formulary decisions .", "Participants_prec": 1.0, "Outcome_recl": 0.56032192166807548, "Participants_text": "The impact of schizophrenic patient functionality on service utilization and cost .", "Intervention_corr_gt": null, "Outcome_prec": 0.7822061965811965, "Intervention_corr": 0.6133221952882052, "Outcome_prec_gt": null, "Intervention_recl": 0.66666666666666674, "docid": "10539493", "Intervention_prec_gt": null, "Participants_corr_gt": null, "Intervention_prec": 0.94999999999999996, "Participants_corr": 0.53918386588974299, "Outcome_corr_gt": null, "Participants_recl_gt": null}

A secondary data analysis from that study suggested that cigarette smoking is also significantly decreased by fluoxetine , but the magnitude of the decrease is limited and few of these patients totally quit smoking with fluoxetine treatment alone . Another secondary data analysis from that study suggested that marijuana smoking was also significantly decreased in a subgroup of subjects who demonstrated cannabis abuse and that the magnitude of this improvement was robust .

These measurements were performed on each of three occasions following one week of matched placebo , quinapril 40 mg or losartan 50 mg daily administered in a double - blind randomized crossover design . \n RESULTS Sodium nitroprusside , substance P and bradykinin produced dose - dependent increases in the blood flow of infused forearm ( analysis of variance [ ANOVA ] , p < 0.001 for all ) . Although sodium nitroprusside did not affect plasma t - PA concentrations , they were increased dose - dependently in the infused forearm by substance P and bradykinin infusion ( ANOVA , p < 0.001 for both ) .

Health status was measured using the SF12 physical and mental summary component T - scores and pain was measured with a 100 mm visual analogue pain scale . Secondary outcomes were health utility and perceived health both measured with the EuroQol instrument , mental health measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale , disability with the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and economic costs measured from a societal perspective . \n RESULTS Mean waiting times were 43 days ( sigma = +/-16 ) and 105 days ( sigma = +/-51 ) for ' fast track ' and ' ordinary ' appointments , respectively . Both groups showed significant improvements in mean [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ] scores for pain : 11 ( 7 , 16)(P < 0.001 ) ; physical health status : 4 ( 2 , 5 ) ( P < 0.001 ) ; mental health status : 2 ( 0.1 , 4 ) ( P < 0.02 ) ; and health utility : 0.11 ( 0.07 , 0.16 ) ( P < 0.001 ) by the end of the 15-month period of the study , but there was no significant difference between either arm of the study . \n CONCLUSIONS Rationing by delay was not detrimental to either mental or physical health and patients in both arms of the study showed significant and similar improvement in health by 15 months .

The lead system evaluated was a dual - coil transvenous defibrillation lead with a left pectoral pulse generator emulator . Shocks were delivered either between the right ventricular coil and proximal atrial coil ( lead ) or between the right ventricular coil and an active can in common with the atrial coil ( active can ) . Delivered energy at DFT was 4.2 +/- 4.1 J in the lead configuration and 5.0 +/- 3.7 J in the active can configuration ( P = NS ) . Peak current was 32 % higher with an active can ( P < 0.01 ) , whereas shock impedance was 18 % lower ( P < 0.001 ) . Moreover , a low threshold ( < or = 3 J ) was observed in 61 % of subjects in the lead configuration but in only 36 % in the active can configuration ( P < 0.05 ) .

The primary aim was to test whether treatment with LMWH , started within 30 h of stroke onset , is superior to aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke during the first 14 days . \n FINDINGS The frequency of recurrent ischaemic stroke during the first 14 days was 19/244 ( 8.5 % ) in dalteparin - allocated patients versus 17/225 ( 7.5 % ) in aspirin - allocated patients ( odds ratio=1.13 , 95 % CI 0.57 - 2.24 ) . The secondary events during the first 14 days also revealed no benefit of dalteparin compared with aspirin : symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage 6/224 versus 4/225 ; symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral haemorrhage 26/224 versus 32/225 ; progression of symptoms within the first 48 hours 24/224 versus 17/225 ; and death 21/224 versus 16/225 . There were no significant differences in functional outcome or death at 14 days or 3 months . \n INTERPRETATION The present data do not provide any evidence that LMWH is superior to aspirin for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation .

Adding latanoprost to timolol reduced IOP with 5.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) and switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced IOP with 5.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) , which caused in each group a significant IOP reduction of about 25 % . \n CONCLUSIONS The effect of latanoprost was additive to that of timolol , and a good effect on IOP reduction was also achieved by switching from timolol to latanoprost , suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to combination treatment . \n\n .", "Intervention_corr_gt": 0.4822847898193901, "Outcome_prec": 0.59365079365079365, "Intervention_corr": 0.42131222825044856, "Outcome_prec_gt": 0.75978835978835979, "Intervention_recl": 0.36316666666666669, "docid": "11401641", "Intervention_prec_gt": 0.90900000000000003, "Participants_corr_gt": 0.6575503790895646, "Intervention_prec": 0.63194444444444442, "Participants_corr": 0.6308775059217484, "Outcome_corr_gt": 0.66099069953675149, "Participants_recl_gt": 0.44625452520189363}

By using power spectral analysis , the low frequency and high frequency components of heart rate variability can be calculated reflecting the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity . The purpose of this study was to investigate to what extent acupuncture applied into the thenar muscle and into the cavum concha of the ear induced changes in the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nervous system in healthy subjects . \n MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve healthy volunteers , six men and six women , mean age 34.4 ( range 23 - 48 ) participated in three balanced , randomly distributed sessions . At an individual initial visit the 12 volunteers were introduced to the needle sensation by having a needle inserted into the point LI 11 . The needle sensation was evoked and the subject was trained to identify the characteristic needle sensation . The introduction was followed by three test sessions . \n SESSION A A short acupuncture needle , ( Seirin no 3 , &emptyv;0.20x15 mm ) was inserted perpendicular into the earpoint , Lu 1 , in the left inferior hemi - conchae . \n SESSION B An acupuncture needle ( Hwato , &emptyv;0.30x30 mm ) was inserted perpendicular into the Hegu point ( LI 4 ) in the middle of the right dorsal thenar muscle . \n SESSION C An acupuncture needle ( Hwato , &emptyv;0.30x30 mm ) was inserted perpendicular superficially into the skin overlying the Hegu point on the left hand .

Stimulation of the ear induced a significant increase in the parasympathetic activity during the stimulation period of 25 min ( P<0.05 ) and during the post - stimulation period of 60 min ( P<0.05 ) . No significant changes were observed in either the sympathetic activity , blood pressure or heart rate . Stimulation of the thenar muscle resulted in a significant increase in the sympathetic and the parasympathetic activity during the stimulation period ( P<0.01 ) and during the post - stimulation period ( P<0.01 and P<0.001 , respectively ) . A significant decrease in the heart rate frequency ( P<0.05 ) at the end of the post - stimulation period was also demonstrated .

The usual combination is foam ear plugs under headset or helmet muffs . Much of the research that spurred the introduction of foam earplugs indicated little change in speech intelligibility in persons with normal hearing . However , aircrew often complain about having to maximize intercom volume for speech understanding , causing a situation with no reserve volume and bad sound quality . In recent years , further developments have included so - called hi - fi plugs and custom made ear plugs which are claimed to improve speech communication . The aim of the present project was to investigate different types of ear plugs and their effect on speech intelligibility in helicopter noise . \n METHODS Each of nine normal - hearing pilot subjects were placed in an environment of recorded helicopter noise from a BO-105 helicopter . Speech audiometry was performed under four different conditions : headset only , and three different ear plugs worn under the headset . Fitting of the ear plugs was performed by an ear , nose and throat specialist to ensure similar conditions . The sequence of test conditions was randomized and double - blind . In addition , a subjective rating scale was used . \n RESULTS Wearing foam ear plugs under the headset decreased speech intelligibility dramatically . The \" hi - fi \" plug was somewhat better than foam plugs , and the custom made ear plug provided a speech intelligibility close to the headset - only situation . Subjective rating scores coincided with these findings . \n DISCUSSION In helicopter noise , custom made ear plugs may provide a much improved speech intelligibility over conventional plugs when worn under a headset , while maintaining improved noise protection over the headset - alone situation . Custom made ear plugs might therefore be a good alternative to other forms of enhanced noise protection in helicopters .", "Participants_prec": 0.64588744588744584, "Outcome_recl": 0.40694444444444439, "Participants_text": "Double hearing protection and speech intelligibility - room for improvement . \n\n .

The purpose is to improve stone fragmentation and clearance rates . \n MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and six consecutive patients with ureteric calculi at different levels were treated by ESWL using Siemens Lithostar 2 machine . Patients have been randomized into two treatment groups . The first group was treated by standard ESWL and included 54 patients . The second group was treated by ESWL with diuresis during the ESWL session . Shock waves were given at a rate of 90 shocks/minute with energy starting from 10 up to 18 KV. During the ESWL session the patient belonging to the second group received i.v . infusion of 500 ml normal saline containing 40 mg furosemide as a diuretic . The stone fragmentation and clearance rates were the two end points for evaluation . \n RESULTS The average number of sessions per stone was 1.92 and 1.5 and the average number of shocks per stone was 6295 and 5300 for the first and second treatment groups respectively .

Analysis of the results in relation to stone location showed that the two treatment groups were comparable for upper and middle ureteric calculi .

Swallowing and arousal are crucial to prevent laryngeal chemoreflex stimulation . Our aim was to examine these reflexes and breathing responses in healthy neonates after pharyngeal infusion of water in the supine versus the prone position , controlling for sleep state . \n METHODS A total of 10 term infants were recruited after parental consent and ethics approval . Polygraphic recordings included sleep state ( active and quiet sleep by electroencephalogram , eye movements , breathing , and behavior ) , cardiorespiratory measurements ( nasal airflow , chest wall movements , heart rate , and oxygen saturation ) , swallowing , and esophageal activity ( solid state pressure catheter ) . Initial sleeping position was assigned randomly . Measurements were made for 1 minute before and after 0.4 mL of water was instilled into the oropharynx . To detect a 30 % decrease in swallowing , power analysis indicated that >/=10 babies were required . Analysis , blinded to position , was made using nonparametric statistics . \n RESULTS Of the 164 infusions , the most commonly evoked airway protective responses to pharyngeal infusion were swallowing ( 95 % ) and arousal ( 54 % ) . After infusion in active sleep , there was a significant reduction in swallowing and breathing when the prone position was compared with the supine position ( prone : 21.3 [ 1.0 ] swallows/min and -9.6 [ 2.1 ] breaths/min ; and supine : 32 ( 2.2 ) and -2 . 9 ( 1.5 ) , respectively ) . However , there was no difference in the occurrence of arousal after water infusion . \n CONCLUSION These data suggest that airway protection is compromised in the prone sleeping position during active sleep , even in healthy infants exposed to minute pharyngeal fluid volumes of 0.4 mL. This is because swallowing rate is reduced significantly , and there is no compensatory increase in arousal . The reduction in airway protective reflexes when in the prone position and in active sleep may be the mechanism for the increased risk of SIDS in the prone position .", "Participants_prec": 0.90937500000000004, "Outcome_recl": 0.45235042735042735, "Participants_text": "Our aim was to examine these reflexes and breathing responses in healthy neonates after pharyngeal infusion of water in the supine versus the prone position , controlling for sleep state . \n METHODS A total of 10 term infants were recruited after parental consent and ethics approval .

We performed a pilot , prospective , open label , randomized design clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan ( 160 mg once a day ) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive African Americans ( n = 88 ) on a low salt ( 100 mEq Na+/day ) for 2 weeks and the same diet supplemented by 100 mEq Na+ for 4 weeks . After this evaluation , while continuing the Na+ supplementation , patients were randomized to valsartan 320 mg/day ( n = 28 ) , or the addition of hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) 12.5 mg/day ( n = 30 ) , or benazepril 20 mg/day to the valsartan 160 mg/day for an additional 6 weeks .

When comparing the efficacy of the three randomized therapeutic regimens while on the Na+ supplement , the valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was the most effective therapy with an incremental reduction in blood pressure of -10.5/-6.9 mm Hg ( P < .01 ) , compared to valsartan 160 mg/day alone . Doubling the dose of valsartan to 320 mg incrementally lowered blood pressure by -3.8/-3.3 mm Hg ( P = not significant ) . The least effective approach was adding benazepril 20 mg/day to valsartan 160 mg/day with no incremental reduction in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reduction of only 1.7 mm Hg ( P = not significant ) .

The aim of the present study was to examine the safety and tolerability of a new and higher dosage regimen that would enable acute stroke patients to achieve and maintain neuroprotective plasma concentrations . \n METHODS A randomised , multi - centre , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group study was carried out at 19 centres in France , Germany and the Netherlands in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke , and onset of symptoms within 12 hours before start of study drug administration . Two loading doses of 3.5 mg/kg of AR - R15896AR over 60 minutes , followed by a 2.5 mg/kg infusion over the next 120 minutes were given . Eight hours after the start of the loading dose infusion , the first maintenance dose ( 120 mg ) was administered over 60 minutes . Eight further maintenance infusions were administered at intervals of 8 hours over a total treatment period of 3 days . Main variables were safety , tolerability and pharmacokinetics . Follow - up assessments also included the Barthel Index ( BI ) and the NIH Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) at 4 - 7 days after the end of the last infusion and at 30 days after the onset of stroke . \n RESULTS 103 patients with acute ischaemic stroke were randomised to either treatment with AR - R15896AR ( 70 patients ) or placebo ( 33 patients ) . Mortality was not significantly different in the AR - R15896AR group compared with the placebo group ( 10 % vs. 6 % ) . Serious adverse events during treatment due to psychiatric conditions were associated with AR - R15896AR ( 3 vs. 0 ) . Other side effects were more common in the group treated with AR - R15896AR : vomiting ( 29 % vs. 9 % ) , nausea ( 23 % vs. 12 % ) , fever ( 17 % vs. 12 % ) , agitation ( 7 % vs. 3 % ) , dizziness ( 7 % vs. 0 % ) , and hallucinations ( 6 % vs. 0 % ) . No significant difference between the two groups ( with respect to the proportions of patients with favourable outcome ) was detected in either the analysis of the BI or the NIHSS.

This prospective randomized , double - blinded , dose - response study examined the anesthetic and recovery profiles of 60- and 80-mg doses of preservative - free plain mepivacaine for ambulatory spinal anesthesia . Sixty patients undergoing ambulatory anterior cruciate ligament repair of the knee under spinal anesthesia were randomized into two groups ; Group 1 ( 29 patients ) received 4 mL of 1.5 % ( 60-mg dose ) and Group 2 ( 31 patients ) received 4 mL of 2 % ( 80-mg dose ) of plain mepivacaine . All patients received a combined spinal - epidural anesthetic technique . The epidural catheter was used only in the event the surgery outlasted the duration of surgical anesthesia with subarachnoid mepivacaine . Epidural supplementation was administered in three patients ( 12 % ) in Group 1 and one patient ( 3 % ) in Group 2 when the sensory block regressed to L-1 with surgery expected to last longer than 15 min . The cephalad dermatome level of the block and degree of motor block was comparable in the two groups .

The DCCT proved that intensive treatment reduced the risks of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy by 35 % to 90 % compared with conventional treatment . The absolute risks of retinopathy and nephropathy were proportional to the mean glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA(1c ) ) level over the follow - up period preceding each event . Intensive treatment was most effective when begun early , before complications were detectable . These risk reductions , achieved at a median HbA(1c ) level difference of 9.1 % for conventional treatment vs 7.3 % for intensive treatment have been maintained through 7 years of EDIC , even though the difference in mean HbA(1c ) levels of the 2 former randomized treatment groups was only 0.4 % at 1 year ( P<.001 ) ( 8.3 % in the former conventional treatment group vs 7.9 % in the former intensive treatment group ) , continued to narrow , and became statistically nonsignificant by 5 years ( 8.1 % vs 8.2 % , P =.09 ) .

The DCCT proved that intensive treatment reduced the risks of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy by 35 % to 90 % compared with conventional treatment . The absolute risks of retinopathy and nephropathy were proportional to the mean glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA(1c ) ) level over the follow - up period preceding each event .

These risk reductions , achieved at a median HbA(1c ) level difference of 9.1 % for conventional treatment vs 7.3 % for intensive treatment have been maintained through 7 years of EDIC , even though the difference in mean HbA(1c ) levels of the 2 former randomized treatment groups was only 0.4 % at 1 year ( P<.001 ) ( 8.3 % in the former conventional treatment group vs 7.9 % in the former intensive treatment group ) , continued to narrow , and became statistically nonsignificant by 5 years ( 8.1 % vs 8.2 % , P =.09 ) .

We investigated in healthy nonobese males the effect of the GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant in different metabolic conditions . This is a model for acute GHD without the alterations in body composition associated with GHD. We compared the effect of pegvisomant with that of placebo before and after 3 d of fasting . In addition , we investigated the effect of pegvisomant under normal , i.e. fed , conditions . Three days of fasting as well as pegvisomant alone decreased serum free IGF - I levels ( 1.0 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.05 ng/ml and 0.86 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.23 ng/ml , respectively ) .

Secondary outcomes included blood lipid , fasting glucose , and insulin levels and side effects related to elevated blood pressure and increased dietary fiber intake . \n RESULTS The oat cereal group experienced a 7.5 mm Hg reduction in SBP ( P &lt.01 ) and a 5.5 mm Hg reduction in DBP ( P &lt.02 ) , while there was virtually no change in either SBP or DBP in the control group . In the oat cereal group , a trend was observed for a lower total insulin response to a glucose load , suggesting improved insulin sensitivity .
